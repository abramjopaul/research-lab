Matt Gaetz surprised a roomful of angry protesters Thursday night when he called for President Donald Trump to release his tax returns.  But the Florida Republican stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena those returns.  Gaetz, a first-term congressman from the Sunshine State\\u2019s panhandle, has stood by Trump, campaigning with him over the past weekend and closing his raucous one-hour town hall at the Oops Bowling Alley here Thursday night by saying he wanted to \\u201cmake America great again.\\u201d  But he surprised the audience when he said, \\u201cAbsolutely, Donald Trump should release his tax returns.\\u201d  Donna Waters, a 56-year-old lawyer from Pensacola, became emotional Thursday night as she pressed Gaetz for an answer.  \\u201cI\\u2019m the descendant of an immigrant, he came to America in 1607 to a town called Jamestown, and my family\\u2019s been here ever since,\\u201d Waters said, noting that her family members have fought in every major US war, including both sides of the Civil War.  \\u201cWhenever there\\u2019s a threat to this country, my family has stepped forward,\\u201d Waters said, tearing up. \\u201cThere are allegations that a hostile foreign country is committing acts of undeclared war by infiltrating the highest levels of our government.\\u201d  Waters continued: \\u201cYou are on the Judiciary Committee. You have said they are going to investigate the Russian allegations. Yes or no, Yes or no \\u2013 let me ask my question \\u2013 will you call for the release of President Trump\\u2019s income tax returns?\\u201d  As Gaetz took back the microphone, the crowd immediately began screaming, \\u201cYes or no! Yes or no!\\u201d  Then Gaetz said, \\u201cIf you hear me out, you\\u2019ll like my answer,\\u201d and called for Trump\\u2019s returns. The line garnered some rare applause from the crowd that was otherwise mostly livid over Gaetz\\u2019s push to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and a string of other issues.  During his presidential campaign, Trump became the first major-party nominee since 1972 not to release his tax returns \\u2013 citing ongoing IRS audits and saying he would do so once those audits were completed.  But last month, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the President will not release his returns. Conway later sought to clarify her remarks, asserting there had been no change in position from the campaign and that Trump\\u2019s business advisers had urged him not to release the documents.  Throughout Gaetz\\u2019s hour-long town hall here just outside of Pensacola, protesters booed, chanted, yelled over him and jeered Gaetz. At one point, a questioner asked Gaetz if he would vote to impeach Trump, to which the crowd began chanting, \\u201cImpeach Trump! Impeach Trump!\\u201d  \\u201cI do not agree with President Trump on every issue, I do not agree with any human being on Planet Earth on every issue, but I support President Trump and I\\u2019m going to back him up,\\u201d Gaetz said.  Gaetz often spoke directly with the protesters. Outside a meeting with constituents at the Santa Rosa County Building, Sarah Coutu, a mother of eight from Milton and member of Florida Panhandle Progressives, confronted him on his EPA bill.  As he attempted to talk through his call to abolish the EPA, protesters screamed, \\u201cYour last term!\\u201d over him and he walked into the building.  But Gaetz also tightly controlled access to his earlier events, holding an earlier meeting with constituents in a back room of a restaurant that had limited access.  During a stop at Grover T\\u2019s BBQ in Milton, Florida, Gaetz was ushered past more than 100 protesters by a group of sheriff\\u2019s deputies and members of Bikers for Trump, who said they were providing security.\",\n          \"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle officially declare their bankruptcy\\nThe financial situation of the prince Harry and Meghan Markle is not as great as one might think, and it is actually giving them a hard time. This has been revealed by a British royal biographer who also revealed the couple\\u2019s excessive spendings that led them to the broke status in the first place.  The British biographer Tom Bower has been in charge of this case for quite some time, and he finally gathered enough information to make the report through the Express newsletter. According to him, the couple has spent a significant amount of money on luxury items, services and a fancy lifestyle, despite the fact that their income is not high enough to cover those spendings.  This financial sprawl down started in early 2020 when they announced that they would step down as royal family members, meaning that they would not longer work in the institution, but that also means they have the economic support they had as Senior Royals, cut off. After that, the couple moved to the US to start their excessive spending.  In the last months, the wed couple starred in their own Netflix docuseries, titled \\u201cHarry & Meghan\\u201d, shortly after, Harry made the successful release of his memorial autobiographical book, \\u201cSpare\\u201d, with which he broke multiple records for book sales. It seems, however, that this income is not enough to support their purchases.  \\u201cShe thought that the prince had hundreds of millions if not billions, and now they are in trouble. She wants to ride Cadillacs and have private jets available all the time. They are now desperately gathering funds for this sort of spendings\\u201d, Bower spoke about the expensive lifestyle they have.  As of now, none of them have spoken about the matter in public, though they have had mentioned in the past that they were in desperate need for higher incomes.  What do you think about this? Was this preventable?\",\n          \"Party That Didn\\u2019t Care About Children Dying In School Shooting Now Concerned About Children\\u2019s Lives\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \\u2013 After sending lot\\u2019s of thoughts and prayers to the families of the Uvalde shooting victims, Republicans have now decided to care about the lives of children now that it\\u2019s convenient for them. Thus, they have overturned Roe V. Wade, meaning potentially thousands of women won\\u2019t have access to abortion in hard right states.  \\u201cThink of the kids, damnit!\\u201d Argued Republican senator Jeff Worsh. \\u201cNow that

A new Muslim ban. Tariffs on all imported goods and \\u201cfreedom cities\\u201d built on federal land.  Much of the 2024 presidential campaign has been dominated by the myriad investigations into former President Donald Trump and the subsequent charges against him. But with less than a year until Election Day, Trump is dominating the race for the Republican nomination and has already laid out a sweeping set of policy goals should he win a second term.  His ideas, and even the issues he focuses on most, are wildly different from President Joe Biden\\u2019s proposals. If implemented, Trump\\u2019s plans would represent a dramatic government overhaul arguably more consequential than that of his first term. His presidency, especially the early days, was marked by chaos, infighting and a wave of hastily written executive orders that were quickly overturned by the courts.  Some of his current ideas would probably end up in court or impeded by Congress. But Trump\\u2019s campaign and allied groups are assembling policy books with detailed plans.  A look at his agenda:  DISMANTLING THE \\u2018DEEP STATE\\u2019  Trump would try to strip tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections. That way, they could be fired as he seeks to \\u201ctotally obliterate the deep state.\\u201d  What to know about the 2024 Election  Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.  American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. AP\\u2019s Role: The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night, with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Learn more.  The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night, with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP\\u2019s complete coverage of this year\\u2019s election.  He would try to accomplish that by reissuing a 2020 executive order known as \\u201cSchedule F.\\u201d That would allow him to reclassify masses of employees, with a particular focus, he has said, on \\u201ccorrupt bureaucrats who have weaponized our justice system\\u201d and \\u201ccorrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus.\\u201d Given his anger at the FBI and federal prosecutors pursuing criminal cases against him, Trump probably would target people linked to those prosecutions for retribution.  Beyond the firings, he wants to crack down on government officials who leak to reporters. He also wants to require that federal employees pass a new civil service test.  THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER  Trump has pledged to \\u201cimmediately stop the invasion of our southern border\\u201d and end illegal immigration.  As part of that plan, he says he would immediately direct U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to undertake the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. He would target people who are legally living in the United States but harbor \\u201cjihadist sympathies\\u201d and revoke the student visas of those who espouse anti-American and antisemitic views.  In a bid to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump says he will move thousands of troops currently stationed overseas and shift federal agents, including those at the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI, to immigration enforcement. He also wants to build more of the border wall.  Trump wants to reimpose his travel ban that originally targeted seven Muslim-majority countries and expand it to \\u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists out of the country.\\u201d In the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel, he has pledged to put in place \\u201cideological screening\\u201d for immigrants. His aim: bar \\u201cdangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs,\\u201d as well as those who \\u201cempathize with radical Islamic terrorists and extremists.\\u201d  To deter migrants, he has said he would end birthright citizenship, using an an executive order that would introduce a legally untested interpretation of the 14th Amendment. The order would prevent federal agencies from granting automatic citizenship to the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally. It would require that at least one parent be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for their children to be eligible for passports, Social Security numbers and other benefits.  TRADE  Trump says he will institute a system of tariffs of perhaps 10% on most foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices.  He will urge that Congress pass a \\u201cTrump Reciprocal Trade Act,\\u201d giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S.  Much of the agenda focuses on China. Trump has proposed a four-year plan to phase out Chinese imports of essential goods, including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals. He wants to ban Chinese companies from owning vital U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and agriculture, and says he will force Chinese owners to sell any holdings \\u201cthat jeopardize America\\u2019s national security.\\u201d  FOREIGN POLICY  Trump claims that even before he is inaugurated, he will have settled the war between Russia and Ukraine. That includes, he says, ending the \\u201cendless flow of American treasure to Ukraine\\u201d and asking European allies to reimburse the U.S. for the cost of rebuilding stockpiles.  It is unclear whether he would insist that Russia withdraw from territory in Ukraine it seized in the war that it launched in February 2022.  Trump has said he will stand with Israel in its war with Hamas and support Israel\\u2019s efforts to \\u201cdestroy\\u201d the militant group. He says he will continue to \\u201cfundamentally reevaluate\\u201d NATO\\u2019s purpose and mission.  TRANSGENDER RIGHTS  Trump says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that \\u201conly two genders,\\u201d as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States.  As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he will declare that hospitals and health care providers that offer transitional hormones or surgery no longer meet federal health and safety standards and will be blocked from receiving federal funds, including Medicaid and Medicare dollars.  He would push Congress to prohibit hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors in all 50 states.  Doctors typically guide kids toward therapy before medical intervention. At that point, hormone treatments such as puberty blockers are far more common than surgery. They have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are standard treatments backed by major doctors\\u2019 organizations, including the American Medical Association.  ENERGY  Trump\\u2019s goal, he says, is for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, including China.  Under the mantra \\u201cDRILL, BABY, DRILL,\\u201d he says he would ramp up oil drilling on public lands and offer tax breaks to oil, gas, and coal producers. He would roll back Biden administration efforts to encourage the adoption of electric cars and reverse proposed new pollution limits that would require at least 54% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.  And again, he says, he will exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden admiration targeting incandescent lightbulbs, gas stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.  EDUCATION  Trump has pledged to terminate the Department of Education, but he also wants to exert enormous influence over local school districts and colleges.  He would push the federal government to give funding preference to states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure, adopt merit pay to reward good teachers and allow the direct election of school principals by parents.  He has said he would cut funding for any school that has a vaccine or mask mandate and will promote prayer in public schools.  Trump also wants a say in school curricula, vowing to fight for \\u201cpatriotic education.\\u201d He says that under his administration, schools will \\u201cteach students to love their country, not to hate their country like they\\u2019re taught right now\\u201d and will promote \\u201cthe nuclear family\\u201d including \\u201cthe roles of mothers and fathers\\u201d and the \\u201cthings that make men and women different and unique.\\u201d  To protect students, he says he will support school districts that allow trained teachers to carry concealed weapons. He would provide federal funding so schools can hire veterans, retired police officers, and other trained gun owners as armed school guards.  HOMELESSNESS  Trump wants to force the homeless off city streets by building tent cities on large open parcels of inexpensive land. At the same time, he says he will work with states to ban urban camping, giving violators the choice between being arrested or receiving treatment.  He also wants to bring back large mental institutions to reinstitutionalize those who are \\u201cseverely mentally ill\\u201d or \\u201cdangerously deranged.\\u201d  PUBLIC SAFETY  Trump would again push to send the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violence. He would use the federal government\\u2019s funding and prosecution authorities to strong-arm local governments.  He says he will require local law enforcement agencies that receive Justice Department grants to use controversial policing measures such as stop-and-frisk. As a deterrent, he says local police should be empowered to shoot suspected shoplifters in the act. \\u201cVery simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store,\\u201d he said in one recent speech.  Trump has called for the death penalty for drug smugglers and those who traffic women and children. He has also pledged a federal takeover of the nation\\u2019s capital, calling Washington a \\u201cdirty, crime-ridden death trap\\u201d unbefitting of the country.] =\",\n          \"Definitions of content categories are as follows:\\n\\nTrue: True information.\\nMisleading Content: Misleading use of information to frame an issue or individual.\\nImposter Content: Bot or LLM generated content.\\nSatire: Humorous but false stories passed off as true.

Mitchell Naficy, MD, a board certified family physician, tells Best Life. He says that staying properly hydrated will help you to maintain a healthy body and mind, as well as prevent dehydration-related health problems.  \\\"Try to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day, and drink more when you are exercising or playing sports, in hot weather, or if you are feeling ill,\\\" he says. Read on to learn what happens to your body if you don't drink any water all day, according to doctors and other experts.  READ THIS NEXT: If You Drink This Beverage Often, Get Your Kidneys Checked, New Study Says.  Your bathroom habits will change.  Besides thirst, changes in the bathroom are among the first symptoms you may notice upon becoming dehydrated. You'll pee less often, and the color of your urine will likely change from a light yellow\\u2014which indicates good hydration\\u2014to a darker yellow or even an amber-brown color. If this happens, it should serve as a reminder that it's time to drink up.  READ THIS NEXT: If This Happens to You in the Bathroom, Get Checked for Heart Failure.  You may experience dizziness, headaches, and fatigue.  When you neglect to drink water all day, you may notice that you feel dizzy, develop a headache, or experience fatigue, says Naficy. This is just one way that \\\"your body is alerting you that it needs fluids to function properly,\\\" he explains.  According to the Cleveland Clinic, you can usually help a dehydration headache resolve by drinking water, resting, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers. However, dizziness may indicate a more serious problem, their experts say. \\\"If you have signs of severe dehydration (such as confusion or dizziness), get medical help right away,\\\" they write.  You could have eye trouble.  When you don't drink water all day, you may also notice changes to your ocular health and vision. \\\"If one does not drink adequate water throughout the day, it can lead to fluid loss in the body,\\\" Besty S. Jacob, OD, a Florida-based optometrist at True Eye Experts, tells Best Life. \\\"This, in turn, can result in dry eye, eyestrain, and vision problems such as irritation, excess watering, blurred vision, or a feeling of a foreign body in the eye. Without sufficient tears to nourish the eyes, they may be more prone to infections.\\\"  Jacob adds that dehydration can cause tired eyes, blurred vision, headaches, and double vision. \\\"To relieve these symptoms, it is important to consume plenty of water and use lubricating eye drops,\\\" he says. \\\"Drinking adequate amounts of water throughout the day is key in ensuring proper hydration for both general health and eye health.\\\"  You may be more susceptible to heat stroke.  Failing to adequately hydrate on hot days can trigger an acute health episode, says Naficy. \\\"One of the most serious issues is a decrease in your body's ability to regulate your internal temperature. When your body is dehydrated, it can't release heat as quickly, causing your body to overheat and leading to heat stroke,\\\" he explains.  Though rehydrating or finding a cooler location can help lessen the symptoms of heat stroke while you wait for help, the Mayo Clinic says you'll need to be seen by a doctor. \\\"Home treatment isn't enough for heatstroke. If you have signs or symptoms of heatstroke, seek emergency medical help,\\\" their experts write.  You could develop digestive problems.  After drinking little to no water in a day, you may also notice that your digestive tract begins to suffer. \\\"Your body needs water to properly digest and absorb important nutrients, so you may experience digestive issues like constipation or cramping,\\\" says Naficy. Being chronically dehydrated can lead to even more severe gastrointestinal problems, including stomach ulcers, gastritis, acid reflux, and more.

Our bodies are made up largely of water stored in fluid compartments: stores of blood and other fluids which surround cells. \\\"Your kidneys and liver, as well as other organs and tissue, continually move electrolytes in and out of cells to adjust fluid levels within the compartments,\\\" explains the Cleveland Clinic.  That's why, when you don't drink water all day, you could be putting yourself at risk of an electrolyte imbalance, says Barbara Kovalenko, RD, a dietician and nutrition consultant for the health app Lasta. \\\"When you lose fluids, you also lose electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium. These are essential for nerve and muscle function and a lack of them can cause cramps and weakness,\\\" she tells Best Life.  Your blood pressure can be affected.  Not drinking water in a day could also lead to a decrease in blood volume, or the amount of fluid in your blood vessels. \\\"Having a normal blood volume is important because it allows your blood to reach all the tissues and organs in your body,\\\" explains Healthcare Associates of Texas.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb  Naficy notes that even short-term dehydration can cause a decrease in blood volume, leading to lightheadedness, paleness, and low blood pressure. \\\"In extreme cases, dehydration can cause confusion, loss of consciousness, and even death\\\" as a result, he warns.  You skin might suffer.  Skin problems are also common in those who neglect to drink enough water. \\\"Dehydration can have a significant impact on the skin,\\\" says Anju Methil, MD, DDV, a dermatologist and the founder of Skin and Shape. \\\"When the body lacks water, the skin may become dry, itchy, and dull-looking,\\\" she adds.  Mathil adds that prolonged dehydration can also cause wrinkles and uneven skin tone. \\\"The skin's ability to perform essential functions like cell turnover is affected without adequate hydration, leading to flaky and unhealthy-looking skin. In addition, dehydrated skin may crack and feel itchy, which can let in bacteria,\\\" she says.] =\",\n          \"Definitions of content categories are as follows:\\n\\nTrue: True information.\\nMisleading Content: Misleading use of information to frame an issue or individual.\\nImposter Content: Bot or LLM generated content.\\nSatire: Humorous but false stories passed off as true.

One investor, who wished to remain anonymous, delivered 10 Nintendo switches purchased from GameStop locations around the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Medical City Children's Hospital Thursday.  The investor said his efforts were made possible by GME gains.  Wall Street has been rattled this week by an organized campaign by small investors to take on large hedge funds by driving up shares of Grapevine-based GameStop and other struggling retailers.  The campaign started on Reddit and other discussion boards as small investors encouraged each other to buy GameStop stock, forcing the bigger players like hedge funds to cover their bets by buying the stock, increasing the price even further.
