performance artist on Monday defended his banana-eating work over the weekend at Art Basel in Miami Beach, boasting he would have done it even earlier but \"I was not too hungry.\"  David Datuna stunned the art world on Saturday when he chowed down on a banana, taped to the wall, which had been called \"Comedian\" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.  Cattelan had sold at least two editions of \"Comedian\" to private collectors for $120,000 each, according to a spokeswoman for Paris-based Galerie Perrotin, which displayed the work in its booth at Art Basel.  People stand near Maurizio Cattelan's Comedian art piece in Miami Beach on Dec. 5, 2019. Courtesy of Art Basel  \"I think this is the first one in art history when one artist eat concept for another,\" Datuna told reporters in New York. \"People ask me, 'You eat banana?' Physically it was banana but banana is just a tool, usually I eat the concept of that you know?\"  Datuna insisted this wasn't a PR stunt, but a serious piece of art when he peeled and consumed the banana on Saturday afternoon.  \"I decided in the morning\" on Saturday to eat the banana art, Datuna said, \"but I was not too hungry so I spent two hours in the Basel.\"  He also expressed his admiration of Cattelan, despite devouring the artist's work.  \"I respect (him) because he makes fun of everything, this is why I respect him,\" Datuna said. \"He's smart, he's genius.\"  A spokeswoman for Cattelan said Monday the artist is not seeking any criminal or civil action against Datuna.  \"What Cattelan did was genius and what I did was also interesting, right?\" Datuna said.  The Georgian-born artist Datuna said he has other performance art projects in the works, coinciding with Super Bowl LIV in early 2020 and then with the next World Cup, in Qatar in 2022.]\n","Category: true\n","\n","Content: [Right-Wing Parents Try To Define ‘Grooming’.\n","Amid book bans, Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law, and vocal protests against drag brunches, one word keeps popping up again and again: grooming.

But what about the cars themselves?  What’s it like to drive a Tesla, and even more important, to have the luxury electric vehicle be your primary mode of transportation?  To find out, I took a Tesla on that most American of excursions: A summer road trip and vacation, in my case from New York City to the great state of Maine.  The folks at Tesla said this would be no problem, but I had a million questions: Do I have to learn how to drive a Tesla? Where do I charge the car on the drive up? Once I’m in Maine, how do I charge the car? And is there enough room in the trunk for me to bring home some lobsters?  Not just any car  To be clear — especially to you Tesla owners — I’m hardly the first person to go on a Tesla road trip. There are more than 600,000 and counting Teslas out there. But if you’re one of the 200 million adults in the U.S. who doesn’t have a Tesla, read on. (Tesla owners might want to peruse this too, if only to keep me honest.)  A Tesla isn’t just any car. Sure, it’s electric and I’ll get into that. But you also discover that you’re part of an ecosystem — as they say — connected to a network by an app that controls the car, plots your routes, and maps your charging needs.  As I climb into the Model 3, the first thing I notice is there’s no dashboard, only a computer monitor. It only takes a few minutes to acclimate yourself to the touchscreen interface, which is highly intuitive (lights, windshield wipers, climate, entertainment). I was never vexed for more than a few seconds.  To start up, you unlock the car with the app, put your foot on the brake, hit gear selector stalk on the right side of the steering column — down for forward, up for reverse — and you’re off!  What does it feel like to drive a Tesla? Different and the same. Of course there is no engine sound at all. Super smooth and super quiet. And the acceleration is insane, like nothing you’ve ever experienced. But there’s nothing to be scared of. In fact, once you get used to the power, the acceleration is game-changing. You see a spot a hundred yards ahead, and you just ... go there! (Ok, be careful.)  One difference is when you take your foot off the gas, (err accelerator), you don’t coast, you really slow down. That’s because the Tesla uses something called regenerative braking — friction if you will — to charge the battery. (Why let the energy of slowing down go to waste?)  I would say it only takes about 10 minutes behind the wheel to become comfortable with the basics. (There are advanced functions like Autopilot, which take a bit longer to get the hang of.)  As for the whole range issue, the Model 3 goes 300 plus miles on a charge and where we’re going in Maine is some 350 miles away, so we will need to recharge on the way. Plus, we don’t want to arrive with an uncharged battery, all of which the software gets. Still, like most, I had range-anxiety. And like most people, my anxiety dissipated over the course of the trip.  How my journey went down  First, we drove north from NYC through Westchester to pick up our niece. The mapping (Tesla uses Google maps for display) then directs us north on route 684 to route 84 east through Hartford and up the Mass Pike on route 91. Most Tesla owners charge up at home, but on a road trip like this, you will need to charge on the road, of course.  The software suggests recharging at a supercharging station in Auburn, Massachusetts, about halfway through the trip. (Interesting because this about where we usually gas up.) Supercharging stations — there are over 700 in the U.S., each with multiple charging docks — are preferable as they are Tesla-owned, which means they are faster and more efficient. You don’t need any expertise to charge, just pull up and plug in. The app can tell you how many charging docks are free. (I never had to wait on this trip.)  Me behind the wheel, going a bit too fast.

of CharcotMarieTooth CMT disease The discovery funded partially by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS part of the National Institutes of Health provided clues rather than clear solutionsAPNs leading to a certain degree of disability due to the degenerative nature of peripheral nerves are commonly recognized as tricky to handle Recent research pointed towards gene mutations concerning how proteins are formed within cells as potential causes of many but not all APNsThese mutations seem to baffle cells capacity to create proteins thus causing stress in motor neurons a common feature of APNs Interestingly inhibition of a protein named GCN2 believed to be connected with this cellular stress has shown mixed results in mouse modelsIn highly specific studies scientists observed APN mice without the GCN2 protein showed minor delay in disease progression Mice treated with a drug to inhibit GCN2 brought about some symptomatic relief but it wasnt consistent across the board notably less beneficial in female miceThe research although encouraging focused on a narrow and highly specific group of mice models As APNs often presents uniquely in different individuals this study highlights the need for more comprehensive research approachesWhile these developments are worth noting they are just the beginning Studies must continue and expand to a broader

Matt Gaetz surprised a roomful of angry protesters Thursday night when he called for President Donald Trump to release his tax returns.  But the Florida Republican stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena those returns.  Gaetz, a first-term congressman from the Sunshine State\\u2019s panhandle, has stood by Trump, campaigning with him over the past weekend and closing his raucous one-hour town hall at the Oops Bowling Alley here Thursday night by saying he wanted to \\u201cmake America great again.\\u201d  But he surprised the audience when he said, \\u201cAbsolutely, Donald Trump should release his tax returns.\\u201d  Donna Waters, a 56-year-old lawyer from Pensacola, became emotional Thursday night as she pressed Gaetz for an answer.  \\u201cI\\u2019m the descendant of an immigrant, he came to America in 1607 to a town called Jamestown, and my family\\u2019s been here ever since,\\u201d Waters said, noting that her family members have fought in every major US war, including both sides of the Civil War.  \\u201cWhenever there\\u2019s a threat to this country, my family has stepped forward,\\u201d Waters said, tearing up. \\u201cThere are allegations that a hostile foreign country is committing acts of undeclared war by infiltrating the highest levels of our government.\\u201d  Waters continued: \\u201cYou are on the Judiciary Committee. You have said they are going to investigate the Russian allegations. Yes or no, Yes or no \\u2013 let me ask my question \\u2013 will you call for the release of President Trump\\u2019s income tax returns?\\u201d  As Gaetz took back the microphone, the crowd immediately began screaming, \\u201cYes or no! Yes or no!\\u201d  Then Gaetz said, \\u201cIf you hear me out, you\\u2019ll like my answer,\\u201d and called for Trump\\u2019s returns. The line garnered some rare applause from the crowd that was otherwise mostly livid over Gaetz\\u2019s push to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and a string of other issues.  During his presidential campaign, Trump became the first major-party nominee since 1972 not to release his tax returns \\u2013 citing ongoing IRS audits and saying he would do so once those audits were completed.  But last month, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the President will not release his returns. Conway later sought to clarify her remarks, asserting there had been no change in position from the campaign and that Trump\\u2019s business advisers had urged him not to release the documents.  Throughout Gaetz\\u2019s hour-long town hall here just outside of Pensacola, protesters booed, chanted, yelled over him and jeered Gaetz. At one point, a questioner asked Gaetz if he would vote to impeach Trump, to which the crowd began chanting, \\u201cImpeach Trump! Impeach Trump!\\u201d  \\u201cI do not agree with President Trump on every issue, I do not agree with any human being on Planet Earth on every issue, but I support President Trump and I\\u2019m going to back him up,\\u201d Gaetz said.  Gaetz often spoke directly with the protesters. Outside a meeting with constituents at the Santa Rosa County Building, Sarah Coutu, a mother of eight from Milton and member of Florida Panhandle Progressives, confronted him on his EPA bill.  As he attempted to talk through his call to abolish the EPA, protesters screamed, \\u201cYour last term!\\u201d over him and he walked into the building.  But Gaetz also tightly controlled access to his earlier events, holding an earlier meeting with constituents in a back room of a restaurant that had limited access.  During a stop at Grover T\\u2019s BBQ in Milton, Florida, Gaetz was ushered past more than 100 protesters by a group of sheriff\\u2019s deputies and members of Bikers for Trump, who said they were providing security.\",\n          \"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle officially declare their bankruptcy\\nThe financial situation of the prince Harry and Meghan Markle is not as great as one might think, and it is actually giving them a hard time. This has been revealed by a British royal biographer who also revealed the couple\\u2019s excessive spendings that led them to the broke status in the first place.  The British biographer Tom Bower has been in charge of this case for quite some time, and he finally gathered enough information to make the report through the Express newsletter. According to him, the couple has spent a significant amount of money on luxury items, services and a fancy lifestyle, despite the fact that their income is not high enough to cover those spendings.  This financial sprawl down started in early 2020 when they announced that they would step down as royal family members, meaning that they would not longer work in the institution, but that also means they have the economic support they had as Senior Royals, cut off. After that, the couple moved to the US to start their excessive spending.  In the last months, the wed couple starred in their own Netflix docuseries, titled \\u201cHarry & Meghan\\u201d, shortly after, Harry made the successful release of his memorial autobiographical book, \\u201cSpare\\u201d, with which he broke multiple records for book sales. It seems, however, that this income is not enough to support their purchases.  \\u201cShe thought that the prince had hundreds of millions if not billions, and now they are in trouble. She wants to ride Cadillacs and have private jets available all the time. They are now desperately gathering funds for this sort of spendings\\u201d, Bower spoke about the expensive lifestyle they have.  As of now, none of them have spoken about the matter in public, though they have had mentioned in the past that they were in desperate need for higher incomes.  What do you think about this? Was this preventable?\",\n          \"Party That Didn\\u2019t Care About Children Dying In School Shooting Now Concerned About Children\\u2019s Lives\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \\u2013 After sending lot\\u2019s of thoughts and prayers to the families of the Uvalde shooting victims, Republicans have now decided to care about the lives of children now that it\\u2019s convenient for them.

But what about the cars themselves?  What\\u2019s it like to drive a Tesla, and even more important, to have the luxury electric vehicle be your primary mode of transportation?  To find out, I took a Tesla on that most American of excursions: A summer road trip and vacation, in my case from New York City to the great state of Maine.  The folks at Tesla said this would be no problem, but I had a million questions: Do I have to learn how to drive a Tesla? Where do I charge the car on the drive up? Once I\\u2019m in Maine, how do I charge the car? And is there enough room in the trunk for me to bring home some lobsters?  Not just any car  To be clear \\u2014 especially to you Tesla owners \\u2014 I\\u2019m hardly the first person to go on a Tesla road trip. There are more than 600,000 and counting Teslas out there. But if you\\u2019re one of the 200 million adults in the U.S. who doesn\\u2019t have a Tesla, read on. (Tesla owners might want to peruse this too, if only to keep me honest.)  A Tesla isn\\u2019t just any car. Sure, it\\u2019s electric and I\\u2019ll get into that. But you also discover that you\\u2019re part of an ecosystem \\u2014 as they say \\u2014 connected to a network by an app that controls the car, plots your routes, and maps your charging needs.  As I climb into the Model 3, the first thing I notice is there\\u2019s no dashboard, only a computer monitor. It only takes a few minutes to acclimate yourself to the touchscreen interface, which is highly intuitive (lights, windshield wipers, climate, entertainment). I was never vexed for more than a few seconds.  To start up, you unlock the car with the app, put your foot on the brake, hit gear selector stalk on the right side of the steering column \\u2014 down for forward, up for reverse \\u2014 and you\\u2019re off!  What does it feel like to drive a Tesla? Different and the same. Of course there is no engine sound at all. Super smooth and super quiet. And the acceleration is insane, like nothing you\\u2019ve ever experienced. But there\\u2019s nothing to be scared of. In fact, once you get used to the power, the acceleration is game-changing. You see a spot a hundred yards ahead, and you just ... go there! (Ok, be careful.)  One difference is when you take your foot off the gas, (err accelerator), you don\\u2019t coast, you really slow down. That\\u2019s because the Tesla uses something called regenerative braking \\u2014 friction if you will \\u2014 to charge the battery. (Why let the energy of slowing down go to waste?)  I would say it only takes about 10 minutes behind the wheel to become comfortable with the basics. (There are advanced functions like Autopilot, which take a bit longer to get the hang of.)  As for the whole range issue, the Model 3 goes 300 plus miles on a charge and where we\\u2019re going in Maine is some 350 miles away, so we will need to recharge on the way. Plus, we don\\u2019t want to arrive with an uncharged battery, all of which the software gets. Still, like most, I had range-anxiety. And like most people, my anxiety dissipated over the course of the trip.  How my journey went down  First, we drove north from NYC through Westchester to pick up our niece. The mapping (Tesla uses Google maps for display) then directs us north on route 684 to route 84 east through Hartford and up the Mass Pike on route 91. Most Tesla owners charge up at home, but on a road trip like this, you will need to charge on the road, of course.  The software suggests recharging at a supercharging station in Auburn, Massachusetts, about halfway through the trip. (Interesting because this about where we usually gas up.) Supercharging stations \\u2014 there are over 700 in the U.S., each with multiple charging docks \\u2014 are preferable as they are Tesla-owned, which means they are faster and more efficient. You don\\u2019t need any expertise to charge, just pull up and plug in. The app can tell you how many charging docks are free. (I never had to wait on this trip.)

But what about the cars themselves?  What\\u2019s it like to drive a Tesla, and even more important, to have the luxury electric vehicle be your primary mode of transportation?  To find out, I took a Tesla on that most American of excursions: A summer road trip and vacation, in my case from New York City to the great state of Maine.  The folks at Tesla said this would be no problem, but I had a million questions: Do I have to learn how to drive a Tesla? Where do I charge the car on the drive up? Once I\\u2019m in Maine, how do I charge the car? And is there enough room in the trunk for me to bring home some lobsters?  Not just any car  To be clear \\u2014 especially to you Tesla owners \\u2014 I\\u2019m hardly the first person to go on a Tesla road trip. There are more than 600,000 and counting Teslas out there. But if you\\u2019re one of the 200 million adults in the U.S. who doesn\\u2019t have a Tesla, read on. (Tesla owners might want to peruse this too, if only to keep me honest.)  A Tesla isn\\u2019t just any car. Sure, it\\u2019s electric and I\\u2019ll get into that. But you also discover that you\\u2019re part of an ecosystem \\u2014 as they say \\u2014 connected to a network by an app that controls the car, plots your routes, and maps your charging needs.  As I climb into the Model 3, the first thing I notice is there\\u2019s no dashboard, only a computer monitor. It only takes a few minutes to acclimate yourself to the touchscreen interface, which is highly intuitive (lights, windshield wipers, climate, entertainment). I was never vexed for more than a few seconds.  To start up, you unlock the car with the app, put your foot on the brake, hit gear selector stalk on the right side of the steering column \\u2014 down for forward, up for reverse \\u2014 and you\\u2019re off!  What does it feel like to drive a Tesla? Different and the same. Of course there is no engine sound at all. Super smooth and super quiet. And the acceleration is insane, like nothing you\\u2019ve ever experienced. But there\\u2019s nothing to be scared of. In fact, once you get used to the power, the acceleration is game-changing. You see a spot a hundred yards ahead, and you just ... go there! (Ok, be careful.)  One difference is when you take your foot off the gas, (err accelerator), you don\\u2019t coast, you really slow down. That\\u2019s because the Tesla uses something called regenerative braking \\u2014 friction if you will \\u2014 to charge the battery. (Why let the energy of slowing down go to waste?)  I would say it only takes about 10 minutes behind the wheel to become comfortable with the basics. (There are advanced functions like Autopilot, which take a bit longer to get the hang of.)  As for the whole range issue, the Model 3 goes 300 plus miles on a charge and where we\\u2019re going in Maine is some 350 miles away, so we will need to recharge on the way. Plus, we don\\u2019t want to arrive with an uncharged battery, all of which the software gets. Still, like most, I had range-anxiety. And like most people, my anxiety dissipated over the course of the trip.  How my journey went down  First, we drove north from NYC through Westchester to pick up our niece. The mapping (Tesla uses Google maps for display) then directs us north on route 684 to route 84 east through Hartford and up the Mass Pike on route 91. Most Tesla owners charge up at home, but on a road trip like this, you will need to charge on the road, of course.  The software suggests recharging at a supercharging station in Auburn, Massachusetts, about halfway through the trip. (Interesting because this about where we usually gas up.)

After all, it involves scaling the side of a cliff or simulated rock wall. But experts say it offers participants a wide variety of physical and mental health benefits that are not always found in other sports. And more people are climbing than ever -- thanks in part to hit flicks such as \\\"Free Solo\\\" and \\\"The Dawn Wall.\\\"  Climbing as a recreational sport became popular in the 1980s, with the nation's first indoor climbing gym opening in Seattle. Today, there are more than 500 indoor climbing walls in the United States, powering a $493 million industry, according to market research firm IBISWorld.  More than 10 million Americans were taking part in climbing by 2020, and sport climbing debuted the following year at the Tokyo Summer Olympics.  Sport climbing debuted at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021. Here's US athlete Brooke Raboutou.  See more  The new Olympic sport features three disciplines: bouldering, which is performed on lower walls without ropes; speed climbing, where the fastest person to the top wins; and lead climbing, where the goal is to climb as high as possible within a time limit.  While rock climbing attracts thrill-seekers, others appreciate it as an excellent workout that also calms and sharpens the mind.  Here are eight reasons you may wish to give rock climbing a try.  Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.  Increases cardiorespiratory fitness  Fast-moving sports such as running, soccer and cycling come to mind as workouts that elevate your heart rate. But climbing gets your heart pumping, too, as it involves a lot of pulling, pushing and lifting. And the more challenging the climb compared with your ability, the more of a workout.  Bouldering is performed without ropes. Here, a man practices at a Jakarta, Indonesia, mall.  Elite athletes with USA Climbing's national team measured heart rates as high as about 150 beats per minute while they climbed, a pretty impressive number, said Zack DiCristino, the team's physical therapist and medical manager. And indoor rock climbing was found to require the same energy expenditure as running 8 to 11 minutes per mile, according to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.  Builds muscle strength  It's not surprising that hauling your body up a cliff wall builds muscle in your arms, but climbing is a full-body exercise. In addition to giving your biceps, triceps and deltoids a workout, it also calls on your abdominals, obliques, glutes, thighs, calves and more.  \\\"You build a lot of upper-body strength when you climb, especially in the hands and fingers,\\\" DiCristino said. \\\"But a lot of people don't realize that if you're using proper technique, your lower body gets quite a workout, too, with all of the squatting and jumping.\\\"  Improves flexibility and balance  Climbing requires you to be able to stretch your arms and legs high and wide, plus contort your body into unusual positions. And, of course, you need to balance on tiny footholds. The more you climb, the better your flexibility, balance and coordination.  See more  \\\"Climbing helps you be aware of your body and improves the way you move your body,\\\" said Nick Wilkes, owner and head instructor at Devils Lake Climbing Guides, a guide service in Madison, Wisconsin.  See more  Enhances memory and problem-solving  Much of rock climbing's skill lies in determining and memorizing your climbing route beforehand. You also need to be able to problem-solve on the fly, changing your route or sequences if you encounter unexpected obstacles. \\\"Climbing is very cognitive in nature,\\\" DiCristino said.  Indeed, activities such as climbing were shown to boost working memory capacity by 50% in a study conducted by University of North Florida researchers. And women are better novice climbers than men, because they are used to solving physical problems with their brains, Wilkes noted.  Boosts communication skills  Communication skills are essential to your safety. Roped climbers have a companion on the ground called a belayer, who handles the rope through a device to manage the tension or slack, catch any falls and lower the climber. Throughout a climb, the duo must constantly communicate about such concerns as desired rope tension, when the climber wants to rest and when it's time to come down.  Communication is key, with a climber and belayer, who handles the rope, building trust with each other.  \\\"In order for me to be a better climber, I have to communicate clearly with the person belaying me so they know how I'm feeling, when I need a break or if I want to change the climb in any way,\\\" said Lindsay Wenndt, a certified health coach, fitness trainer and owner of Atlanta-based Break Free Fitness.  \\\"The same is true if I'm the one holding the rope,\\\" she said. \\\"It's my job to give encouragement when my partner feels she can't do a certain move, point out a more efficient way to complete a route and be her biggest cheerleader when she crushes a new obstacle or goal.\\\"  Enhances trust  Belaying -- whether you're the belayer or climber -- involves a lot of trust since it's essential to safety. \\\"I have to trust my partner implicitly,\\\" Wenndt said, knowing they've got her if she falls. \\\"I also have to trust myself that I'm going to succeed in at least one thing on that route that I don't think I can do.\\\"  You can build trust more readily through climbing, compared with a lower-risk sport, Wilkes said. \\\"Belaying someone, or being belayed, does have a life-or-death element to it,\\\" he said. \\\"This leads to a deeper experience for folks.\\\"  Builds community  Indoor climbing offers physical, social and psychological benefits, including camaraderie, according to a US Department of Veterans Affairs study on adaptive rock climbing for those with disabilities. And most climbers say the best thing about their sport is that it's a tight-knit community, DiCristino said.  \\\"When you go to a climbing gym, they often have sign-up boards where people are looking for a partner to climb with,\\\" he said. \\\"It's a great way to meet people.\\\"  Combats depression  Like many other forms of exercise, rock climbing can help battle the blues. Researchers in Germany found rock climbing to be successful psychotherapy for adults with depression, thanks to its physical, social and mental benefits. If you're climbing outside, you may get an extra boost as research also has shown spending time in nature is a natural antidepressant.  Climbing is very reflective, too, Wilkes said. \\\"It's a great mirror that shows you how you deal with fear, disappointment and success, and how you deal with the rest of your life as well.\\\"]\\nCategory=\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}],"source":["df_true = df_input.category\n","df_test = pd.DataFrame(df_input.apply(generate_test_prompt, axis=1), columns=[\"content\"])\n","df_test.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"79b89f6a-9369-4d4a-b50f-e1420f538843","metadata":{"id":"79b89f6a-9369-4d4a-b50f-e1420f538843"},"outputs":[],"source":["dataset = TextDataset(df_test)\n","dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2f60f2e3-3206-406c-b6d2-40ab4eb48266","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2f60f2e3-3206-406c-b6d2-40ab4eb48266","outputId":"d4e74882-847c-435a-ef48-ac9d7e195070","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724871668302,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1305700,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:540: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`.
