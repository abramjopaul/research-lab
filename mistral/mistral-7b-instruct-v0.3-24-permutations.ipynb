Matt Gaetz surprised a roomful of angry protesters Thursday night when he called for President Donald Trump to release his tax returns.  But the Florida Republican stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena those returns.  Gaetz, a first-term congressman from the Sunshine State\\u2019s panhandle, has stood by Trump, campaigning with him over the past weekend and closing his raucous one-hour town hall at the Oops Bowling Alley here Thursday night by saying he wanted to \\u201cmake America great again.\\u201d  But he surprised the audience when he said, \\u201cAbsolutely, Donald Trump should release his tax returns.\\u201d  Donna Waters, a 56-year-old lawyer from Pensacola, became emotional Thursday night as she pressed Gaetz for an answer.  \\u201cI\\u2019m the descendant of an immigrant, he came to America in 1607 to a town called Jamestown, and my family\\u2019s been here ever since,\\u201d Waters said, noting that her family members have fought in every major US war, including both sides of the Civil War.  \\u201cWhenever there\\u2019s a threat to this country, my family has stepped forward,\\u201d Waters said, tearing up. \\u201cThere are allegations that a hostile foreign country is committing acts of undeclared war by infiltrating the highest levels of our government.\\u201d  Waters continued: \\u201cYou are on the Judiciary Committee. You have said they are going to investigate the Russian allegations. Yes or no, Yes or no \\u2013 let me ask my question \\u2013 will you call for the release of President Trump\\u2019s income tax returns?\\u201d  As Gaetz took back the microphone, the crowd immediately began screaming, \\u201cYes or no! Yes or no!\\u201d  Then Gaetz said, \\u201cIf you hear me out, you\\u2019ll like my answer,\\u201d and called for Trump\\u2019s returns. The line garnered some rare applause from the crowd that was otherwise mostly livid over Gaetz\\u2019s push to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and a string of other issues.  During his presidential campaign, Trump became the first major-party nominee since 1972 not to release his tax returns \\u2013 citing ongoing IRS audits and saying he would do so once those audits were completed.  But last month, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the President will not release his returns. Conway later sought to clarify her remarks, asserting there had been no change in position from the campaign and that Trump\\u2019s business advisers had urged him not to release the documents.  Throughout Gaetz\\u2019s hour-long town hall here just outside of Pensacola, protesters booed, chanted, yelled over him and jeered Gaetz. At one point, a questioner asked Gaetz if he would vote to impeach Trump, to which the crowd began chanting, \\u201cImpeach Trump! Impeach Trump!\\u201d  \\u201cI do not agree with President Trump on every issue, I do not agree with any human being on Planet Earth on every issue, but I support President Trump and I\\u2019m going to back him up,\\u201d Gaetz said.  Gaetz often spoke directly with the protesters. Outside a meeting with constituents at the Santa Rosa County Building, Sarah Coutu, a mother of eight from Milton and member of Florida Panhandle Progressives, confronted him on his EPA bill.  As he attempted to talk through his call to abolish the EPA, protesters screamed, \\u201cYour last term!\\u201d over him and he walked into the building.  But Gaetz also tightly controlled access to his earlier events, holding an earlier meeting with constituents in a back room of a restaurant that had limited access.  During a stop at Grover T\\u2019s BBQ in Milton, Florida, Gaetz was ushered past more than 100 protesters by a group of sheriff\\u2019s deputies and members of Bikers for Trump, who said they were providing security.\",\n          \"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle officially declare their bankruptcy\\nThe financial situation of the prince Harry and Meghan Markle is not as great as one might think, and it is actually giving them a hard time. This has been revealed by a British royal biographer who also revealed the couple\\u2019s excessive spendings that led them to the broke status in the first place.  The British biographer Tom Bower has been in charge of this case for quite some time, and he finally gathered enough information to make the report through the Express newsletter. According to him, the couple has spent a significant amount of money on luxury items, services and a fancy lifestyle, despite the fact that their income is not high enough to cover those spendings.  This financial sprawl down started in early 2020 when they announced that they would step down as royal family members, meaning that they would not longer work in the institution, but that also means they have the economic support they had as Senior Royals, cut off. After that, the couple moved to the US to start their excessive spending.  In the last months, the wed couple starred in their own Netflix docuseries, titled \\u201cHarry & Meghan\\u201d, shortly after, Harry made the successful release of his memorial autobiographical book, \\u201cSpare\\u201d, with which he broke multiple records for book sales. It seems, however, that this income is not enough to support their purchases.  \\u201cShe thought that the prince had hundreds of millions if not billions, and now they are in trouble. She wants to ride Cadillacs and have private jets available all the time. They are now desperately gathering funds for this sort of spendings\\u201d, Bower spoke about the expensive lifestyle they have.  As of now, none of them have spoken about the matter in public, though they have had mentioned in the past that they were in desperate need for higher incomes.  What do you think about this? Was this preventable?\",\n          \"Party That Didn\\u2019t Care About Children Dying In School Shooting Now Concerned About Children\\u2019s Lives\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \\u2013 After sending lot\\u2019s of thoughts and prayers to the families of the Uvalde shooting victims, Republicans have now decided to care about the lives of children now that it\\u2019s convenient for them. Thus, they have overturned Roe V. Wade, meaning potentially thousands of women won\\u2019t have access to abortion in hard right states.  \\u201cThink of the kids, damnit!\\u201d Argued Republican senator Jeff Worsh. \\u201cNow that

The report shows there were 1,700 new HIV diagnoses in GBM in 2019 compared to 1,500 in 2000.  Overall, the number of people with a new HIV diagnoses fell by 10% (from 4,580 in 2018 to 4,139 in 2019). There was also a 34% decline from a peak of 6,312 new diagnoses in 2014.  There were 1,700 new HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men ( GBM ) in 2019 compared to around 1,600 cases in heterosexual adults. This is the lowest number of new HIV diagnoses in GBM since the year 2000 (1,500) and since 1998 in heterosexual adults (1,600).  HIV transmission in GBM has fallen by 80%; newly acquired HIV infections fell from an estimated peak of 2,700 cases in 2011 to an estimated 540 in 2019 (see background information).  While the proportion of people diagnosed late remained high at 42%, the overall number decreased from around 1,900 in 2015 to 1,300 in 2019. People diagnosed late in 2019 had an eight-fold risk of death compared to those diagnosed promptly.  The decline in HIV transmission in GBM can be directly linked to the increase in combination prevention, including:  the use of condoms  pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP )  frequent HIV testing in a wide range of settings  starting antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) as soon as possible after diagnosis  Treatment is now so effective that 97% of people receiving ART have undetectable levels of virus, which means it is impossible to pass the virus on, even if having sex without condoms. Undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).  HIV testing is vital for preventing HIV -related illness and death and to achieve the goal of ending HIV transmission in the UK by 2030. The UK continues to meet the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets for the third consecutive year \\u2013 however, there are opportunities to improve uptake of testing and support those testing positive to continue their treatment.  Almost 300,000 people declined to have an HIV test when they attended a specialist sexual health service. Black African heterosexual women attendees were more likely to decline a test than Black African heterosexual men (20% versus 9% declined testing) but less likely than heterosexual women and men overall (25% versus 13%). More focused conversations on HIV , testing, prevention and treatment in schools and clinical settings can help to combat high rates of declined tests.  By comparison, only 4% of GBM attending specialist sexual health services declined an HIV test \\u2013 this is the group in which greatest declines in HIV transmission have been achieved.  Dr Valerie Delpech, Head of HIV Surveillance at PHE , said:  In the UK, we have made great progress towards eliminating HIV transmission by 2030. Frequent HIV testing, the offer of PrEP among those most at risk of HIV , together with prompt treatment among those diagnosed, remain key to ending HIV transmission by 2030. Further progress can only be achieved if we also address the inequalities in reducing HIV transmission that exist around sexuality, ethnicity and geography.  The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through sex with a person who is unaware of their HIV infection.  You can protect yourself from HIV by consistent and correct condom use with new and casual partners, by using PrEP , or if your partner is on treatment and is undetectable if they are living with HIV . Correct and consistent condom use will also stop you getting or transmitting other sexually transmitted diseases ( STIs ).  People can get tested through free tests available from sexual health clinics, GP surgeries, as well as through a self-sampling service or by using a self-testing kit.  Background information  Those at risk of HIV and STIs can still access services through sexual health clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many clinics offer online testing, which means people can order tests using clinic websites, take them in the privacy of their own home, return by post and receive results via text, phone call or post.]\\nReturn the category of the content=\",\n          \"Perform these analysis on the content in square brackets:\\n- analyse coherence and flow, nuanced tone or human touch, unusual level of detail.etc and other things to check if content is bot or LLM generated content.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Before the Royal Wedding, people were talking about whether they heard 'yanny' or 'laurel' in an online audio clip.  The debate was fierce. It was The Dress but for ears instead of eyes. Even Donald Trump took a break from playing golf to pipe up.  Now, the man who recorded the sound bite has revealed what he actually said.  It's Laurel. 100 per cent.  (Image: Facebook)  Broadway actor and singer Jay Aubrey Jones, 64, recorded the word 'laurel' back in 2007.  Jay, who comes from New Jersey in he US, trained in pronunciation and produced the clip for Vocabulary.com.  He said he's been \\\"amused to no end\\\" by the debate.  \\\"I recorded my batch of words and I thought that was that,\\\" he told Time.  \\\"I thought, well, it couldn't be that huge. Then I heard the recording again online and I realised what a brouhaha this whole thing was.\\\"  Jay said 'laurel' as a 'wreath worn in victory'. But he did admit he can understand why some people heard something else.  He added: \\\"More often than not, I hear laurel. I can hear a slight trace of yanny.\\\"  (Image: @CloeCouture/Twitter)  The actor recorded around 36,000 words over six months for the vocab website. He did so while doing other acting jobs, so he must have a lot of lines swirling around in his head.  Jay has starred in the likes of Cats on Broadway, and also once appeared on the Michael J Fox show.  While 'yanny or laurel' divided the online world, the argument had already been settled as far as many were concerned.  Professor Brad Story, a speech and language expert at the University of Arizona, last week explained why 'laurel' is correct using scientific methods.  Still, now it's definitive beyond question.]\\nReturn the category of the content=\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}],"source":["df_true = df_input.category\n","df_test = pd.DataFrame(df_input.apply(generate_test_prompt_1, axis=1), columns=[\"content\"])\n","df_test.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"79b89f6a-9369-4d4a-b50f-e1420f538843","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726786778177,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"79b89f6a-9369-4d4a-b50f-e1420f538843"},"outputs":[],"source":["dataset = TextDataset(df_test)\n","dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"2f60f2e3-3206-406c-b6d2-40ab4eb48266","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2f60f2e3-3206-406c-b6d2-40ab4eb48266","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726787712117,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":933954,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}},"outputId":"b35d5180-b773-4c52-c9eb-aab618bedee4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:567: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`.

After all, it involves scaling the side of a cliff or simulated rock wall. But experts say it offers participants a wide variety of physical and mental health benefits that are not always found in other sports. And more people are climbing than ever -- thanks in part to hit flicks such as \\\"Free Solo\\\" and \\\"The Dawn Wall.\\\"  Climbing as a recreational sport became popular in the 1980s, with the nation's first indoor climbing gym opening in Seattle. Today, there are more than 500 indoor climbing walls in the United States, powering a $493 million industry, according to market research firm IBISWorld.  More than 10 million Americans were taking part in climbing by 2020, and sport climbing debuted the following year at the Tokyo Summer Olympics.  Sport climbing debuted at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021. Here's US athlete Brooke Raboutou.  See more  The new Olympic sport features three disciplines: bouldering, which is performed on lower walls without ropes; speed climbing, where the fastest person to the top wins; and lead climbing, where the goal is to climb as high as possible within a time limit.  While rock climbing attracts thrill-seekers, others appreciate it as an excellent workout that also calms and sharpens the mind.  Here are eight reasons you may wish to give rock climbing a try.  Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.  Increases cardiorespiratory fitness  Fast-moving sports such as running, soccer and cycling come to mind as workouts that elevate your heart rate. But climbing gets your heart pumping, too, as it involves a lot of pulling, pushing and lifting. And the more challenging the climb compared with your ability, the more of a workout.  Bouldering is performed without ropes. Here, a man practices at a Jakarta, Indonesia, mall.  Elite athletes with USA Climbing's national team measured heart rates as high as about 150 beats per minute while they climbed, a pretty impressive number, said Zack DiCristino, the team's physical therapist and medical manager. And indoor rock climbing was found to require the same energy expenditure as running 8 to 11 minutes per mile, according to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.  Builds muscle strength  It's not surprising that hauling your body up a cliff wall builds muscle in your arms, but climbing is a full-body exercise. In addition to giving your biceps, triceps and deltoids a workout, it also calls on your abdominals, obliques, glutes, thighs, calves and more.  \\\"You build a lot of upper-body strength when you climb, especially in the hands and fingers,\\\" DiCristino said. \\\"But a lot of people don't realize that if you're using proper technique, your lower body gets quite a workout, too, with all of the squatting and jumping.\\\"  Improves flexibility and balance  Climbing requires you to be able to stretch your arms and legs high and wide, plus contort your body into unusual positions. And, of course, you need to balance on tiny footholds. The more you climb, the better your flexibility, balance and coordination.  See more  \\\"Climbing helps you be aware of your body and improves the way you move your body,\\\" said Nick Wilkes, owner and head instructor at Devils Lake Climbing Guides, a guide service in Madison, Wisconsin.  See more  Enhances memory and problem-solving  Much of rock climbing's skill lies in determining and memorizing your climbing route beforehand. You also need to be able to problem-solve on the fly, changing your route or sequences if you encounter unexpected obstacles. \\\"Climbing is very cognitive in nature,\\\" DiCristino said.  Indeed, activities such as climbing were shown to boost working memory capacity by 50% in a study conducted by University of North Florida researchers. And women are better novice climbers than men, because they are used to solving physical problems with their brains, Wilkes noted.  Boosts communication skills  Communication skills are essential to your safety. Roped climbers have a companion on the ground called a belayer, who handles the rope through a device to manage the tension or slack, catch any falls and lower the climber. Throughout a climb, the duo must constantly communicate about such concerns as desired rope tension, when the climber wants to rest and when it's time to come down.  Communication is key, with a climber and belayer, who handles the rope, building trust with each other.  \\\"In order for me to be a better climber, I have to communicate clearly with the person belaying me so they know how I'm feeling, when I need a break or if I want to change the climb in any way,\\\" said Lindsay Wenndt, a certified health coach, fitness trainer and owner of Atlanta-based Break Free Fitness.  \\\"The same is true if I'm the one holding the rope,\\\" she said. \\\"It's my job to give encouragement when my partner feels she can't do a certain move, point out a more efficient way to complete a route and be her biggest cheerleader when she crushes a new obstacle or goal.\\\"  Enhances trust  Belaying -- whether you're the belayer or climber -- involves a lot of trust since it's essential to safety. \\\"I have to trust my partner implicitly,\\\" Wenndt said, knowing they've got her if she falls. \\\"I also have to trust myself that I'm going to succeed in at least one thing on that route that I don't think I can do.\\\"  You can build trust more readily through climbing, compared with a lower-risk sport, Wilkes said. \\\"Belaying someone, or being belayed, does have a life-or-death element to it,\\\" he said. \\\"This leads to a deeper experience for folks.\\\"  Builds community  Indoor climbing offers physical, social and psychological benefits, including camaraderie, according to a US Department of Veterans Affairs study on adaptive rock climbing for those with disabilities. And most climbers say the best thing about their sport is that it's a tight-knit community, DiCristino said.  \\\"When you go to a climbing gym, they often have sign-up boards where people are looking for a partner to climb with,\\\" he said. \\\"It's a great way to meet people.\\\"  Combats depression  Like many other forms of exercise, rock climbing can help battle the blues. Researchers in Germany found rock climbing to be successful psychotherapy for adults with depression, thanks to its physical, social and mental benefits. If you're climbing outside, you may get an extra boost as research also has shown spending time in nature is a natural antidepressant.  Climbing is very reflective, too, Wilkes said. \\\"It's a great mirror that shows you how you deal with fear, disappointment and success, and how you deal with the rest of your life as well.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 225,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2022-04-22 02:12:00\",\n          \"2022-12-26 00:00:00\",\n          \"2023-05-23 20:02:38+00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"TRUE\",\n          \"imposter content\",\n          \"satire\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"gpt35\",\n          \"theonion\",\n          \"UpliftingNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 30442.10614820945,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 123777.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 213,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3497.0,\n          1001.0,\n          2893.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ratio\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.05036315923260834,\n        \"min\": 0.71,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.83,\n          0.91\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 162,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"truethe content is factual and provides information about the oklahoma attorney general\\u2019s\",\n          \"truethe content is factual and does not contain any misleading information or sat\",\n          \"imposter contentexplanation:the content appears to be a fict\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mapped_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"none\",\n          \"misleading content\",\n          \"true\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}],"source":["# evaluate(df_output['category'], df_output['predicted_category'])\n","df_org.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"id":"6eeaea94-ae89-40f6-b3a2-4190550c4777","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6eeaea94-ae89-40f6-b3a2-4190550c4777","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726787712117,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}},"outputId":"1caf46ff-f4fa-4c82-b251-d67bb54c46df"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy: 0.230\n","Accuracy for label TRUE: 0.514\n","Accuracy for label satire: 0.330\n","Accuracy for label misleading content: 0.043\n","Accuracy for label imposter content: 0.000\n","\n","Classification Report:\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.59      0.51      0.55       107\n","           1       0.94      0.33      0.49       100\n","           2       0.50      0.04      0.08        93\n","           3       0.00      0.00      0.00       100\n","           4       0.00      0.00      0.00         0\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.23       400\n","   macro avg       0.41      0.18      0.22       400\n","weighted avg       0.51      0.23      0.29       400\n","\n","\n","Confusion Matrix:\n","[[ 55   1   1  49   1]\n"," [  0  33   3  62   2]\n"," [ 38   1   4  49   1]\n"," [  0   0   0   0 100]\n"," [  0   0   0   0   0]]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1471: UndefinedMetricWarning: Recall and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no true samples.
