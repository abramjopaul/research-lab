All I know is that without that constricting band going around me I feel so much better. And my nipples are always hard so I\\u2019m getting a lot more attention than before!      Now what do you say to the women who might have significantly bigger breasts than you do? Should they still adopt your ideals?      T: Absolutely!

It\\u2019s a good thing he did. Because had he waited two days longer, he\\u2019d have lost out on $24.1 million.  \\u2018Check your pockets. Check your glove box\\u2019  More than a year ago, Smith bought a ticket to the New York Lotto.  The winning numbers for the May 25, 2016 drawing were: 05 - 12 - 13 - 22 - 25 - 35.  The New York Gaming Commission knew the winning ticket, worth $24.1 million, was sold at a bodega in New York City \\u2013 but it didn\\u2019t know who bought the ticket.  Winners have a year to claim the prize and that expiration day was quickly approaching.  So earlier this year, the New York Lottery started to get the word out.  \\u201cWe urge New York Lottery players: Check your pockets. Check your glove box. Look under the couch cushions. If you have this winning ticket, we look forward to meeting you,\\u201d Gweneth Dean, director of the Commission\\u2019s Division of the Lottery, said at the time.  Play #LOTTO, been to TriBeCa? Check your tickets to see if you\\u2019re a $24M winner! Your winnings expire on 5/25/17! https://t.co/jMAy3GYlmi pic.twitter.com/qtC0tJcS4c \\u2014 New York Lottery (@newyorklottery) May 19, 2017  \\u2018Do I see what I think I see?\\u2019  Smith, a retired security officer, caught a news story about the search for the mystery winner. That inspired him to check his old tickets.  He went up to the closet where the old shirt hung.  When the numbers matched up, he \\u201cstood there for a minute thinking, \\u2018Do I see what I think I see?\\u2019\\u201d  \\u201cI had to stick my head out the window and breathe in some fresh air,: he said. \\u201cI was in serious doubt. I really had to convince myself this was real.\\u201d  \\u201cAll-family discussion\\u201d  That was on May 23, 2017. He\\u2019d have been ineligible to collect after May 25, 2017.  On Wednesday, the New York Lottery released Smith\\u2019s name after completing a review.  \\u201cWe are thrilled that this lucky winner was able to locate this life-changing ticket,\\u201d Dean, of the gaming commission, said.  Smith chose to receive his payments over the course of 26 years.  A father of two and grandfather of 12, he said he plans to have an \\u201call-family discussion\\u201d once things settle down.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1110,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2019-04-11 07:52:00\",\n          \"2023-03-27 17:30:00.373000+00:00\",\n          \"2023-01-17\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"True\",\n          \"satire\",\n          \"misleading content\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"vicuna\",\n          \"UpliftingNews\",\n          \"savedyouaclick\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 27398.985296747516,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 176754.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1158,\n        \"samples\": [\n          375.0,\n          4693.0,\n          1195.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ratio\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04982994002125025,\n        \"min\": 0.63,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.74,\n          0.85,\n          0.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["\n","# Load dataset\n","df_org = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/LLM Research Lab/dataset/dataset-2344.csv')\n","df_org.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["category_mapping = {\n","    'True': 0,\n","    'satire': 1,\n","    'misleading content': 2,\n","    'imposter content': 3\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"da-PvYviSOca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720194244155,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":378,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}}},"id":"da-PvYviSOca","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_input= pd.DataFrame()\n","df_input['content'] = df_org['title'] + '\\n'  + df_org['content']\n","df_input['category'] = df_org['category'].map(category_mapping)\n","df_input.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"Giy-AJKaAy6d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720194246407,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":296,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}},"outputId":"54845065-12a3-4372-aaa2-fd1f71248f2c"},"id":"Giy-AJKaAy6d","execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                             content  category\n","0  STOP EVERYTHING!

Ironically, she was being honored for trying to change that.  The 33-year-old London-based physicist has become something of a phenomenon herself \\u2014 both an irresistible force and immoveable object \\u2014 in her very personal campaign to bring more girls to study and work in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).  Wade has written more than 1,600 Wikipedia entries for long-ignored women scientists, and she has firm beliefs on ideas on how to support girls interested in the field.  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  Wade gained notice when, still in her 20s, she began writing the Wikipedia biographies about women and minority scientists who never got their due \\u2014 from employers, from other scientists, from the public.  As her Wikipedia entries climbed into the dozens, and then into the hundreds, she spoke and wrote more on gender equality in science. She won awards and medals and was cited by Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia.  However, not all of Wiki-world was happy with her. Several of her entries were deleted by other Wikimedians, as the most influential contributors and editors are called. She told TODAY.com that they said a handful of the women she wrote up were not all that well-known.  Wade said that\\u2019s right, that\\u2019s the problem: they should be better known.  One example was Clarice Phelps. Wade heard about the young African-American nuclear chemist, and wrote a Wikipedia bio describing her work on a team that discovered a new periodic-table element at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The Phelps entry bounced on and off Wikipedia as critics deleted it and Wade defended it. In the end, Wade won, and Phelps\\u2019 entry is back on Wikipedia for good.  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  Meanwhile, Wade\\u2019s own Wikipedia entry \\u2014 written by others, not her \\u2014 has grown to 10 printed pages.  As Wade pursues her effort to make sure women scientists are known, she also has beliefs on how to make sure the next generation gets the support they need.  She said girls don\\u2019t need \\u201cwhiz-bang\\u201d experiments at school assemblies: visiting scientists do their show, pack up, depart and nothing changes. Instead, girls and students of color need to be coached and mentored on what to study, and when.  \\u201cPeople assume girls don\\u2019t choose science because they\\u2019re not inspired,\\u201d Wade, 33, said in a recent interview. \\u201cGirls are already interested. It\\u2019s more about making students aware of the different careers in science and getting parents and teachers on board.\\u201d  Women make up only 28 percent of the U.S. work force in STEM, according to the American Association of University Women, and only one in five current engineering or computer science majors are women. Women in STEM earn $60,000 a year, compared to $85,000 for men, according to the American Association of University Women, a non-profit organization that focuses on equity for women.  \\u201cUltimately, we don\\u2019t only need to increase the number of girls choosing science, we need to increase the proportion of women who stay in science,\\u201d said Wade, whose doctorate research at Imperial College in London has been widely cited for advances in digital display technology for TV, computer and phone screens.  One key, she said, is better high school science teachers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re suffering a huge shortage of skills-specialist science teachers across the U.S. and the U.K.,\\u201d she said.  Wade said schools should make it easier for girls and students of color to apply for admissions, grants, fellowships and promotions.  \\u201cWhat do you need to do? Who do you need to speak to? When do you need to make that application? Who should be your cheerleader or supporter?\\u201d  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  She believes schools need to be upfront about their policies on bullying and sexual harassment; universities must provide affordable child care on campus; and conference organizers should provide day care and grants for those with caring responsibilities.  Wade, who grew up the daughter of two physicians and had supportive teachers at private schools, realized at a young age that most people were not as lucky.  \\u201cI genuinely believe that science is better when it\\u2019s done by diverse teams,\\u201d she said.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s also important because we\\u2019re designing new technologies or new scientific solutions to global problems, we want the teams of people creating them to reflect the societies that they\\u2019re serving.\\u201d  \\u201cEven if you don\\u2019t care about any of that, the world desperately needs more scientists and engineers,\\u201d Wade added. \\u201cScience can help solve the world\\u2019s biggest challenges \\u2014 climate change, antibiotic resistance, emerging pandemic-inducing viruses.\\u201d  Looking back on her inclusion in the late Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s 2019 Birthday Honours list, Wade hopes young women scientists will become commonplace at future ceremonies.  And she hopes they will enjoy it as much as she did.  \\u201cIt was pretty wild to be honored by the royal family,\\u201d Wade recalled. She didn\\u2019t meet the queen, but she did take along her mother, Dr. Charlotte Feinmann, to Buckingham Palace.  Her father, Dr. John Wade, couldn\\u2019t attend, but Jess Wade did her best to make it up to him.  \\u201cI took a Tupperware,\\u201d she confided, \\u201cto sneak some royal sandwiches home to my dad.\\u201d\",\n          \"Biden Calls Xi Jinping A Dictator And A Slut\\nSAN FRANCISCO\\u2014Speaking at a solo press conference after a carefully orchestrated diplomatic summit with the Chinese leader, President Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday that he still thought Xi Jinping was a dictator and a slut. \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s nothing that happened in this summit that changed my belief that Xi rules his country with an iron fist and has also been around the block with everyone\\u2014like, seriously, everyone,\\u201d said Biden, denouncing the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party for his authoritarian measures toward his own citizens and claiming he heard a rumor that Xi once had to have his stomach pumped because he had swallowed over a gallon of semen. \\u201cThis is not a good guy we\\u2019re talking about here, people. Also, he\\u2019s not even that hot. That\\u2019s the thing. He\\u2019s just this fugly little skank. Plus, what he\\u2019s doing to the Uyghur people is abhorrent. Almost as abhorrent as Xi blowing any and all takers.\\u201d At press time, Beijing had immediately condemned the statement, remarking that the Chinese president\\u2019s body count was, like, two at most.

The Christopher Columbus statue at Columbus\\u2019 City Hall is one of several across the country that are slated to come down. Statues in both San Francisco and Sacramento are also in the process of being removed.  A separate statue of Christopher Columbus in Columbus, Ohio, will come down from the center of Columbus State Community College's campus.  As of late Friday, more than 8,000 petitioners are calling for Columbus, Ohio\\u2019s renaming to Flavortown.  \\u201cColumbus is an amazing city, but one whose name is tarnished by the very name itself,\\u201d the petition reads.  \\u201cWhy not rename the city Flavortown? The new name is twofold,\\u201d the petition adds. \\u201cFor one, it honors Central Ohio's proud heritage as a culinary crossroads and one of the nation's largest test markets for the food industry. Secondly, cheflebrity Guy Fieri was born in Columbus.\\u201d  Flavortown is Fieri's catchphrase, which he often says on episodes of \\\"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\\\"  Over the years, historians have accused Columbus of participating in slavery, murder and other atrocities against American natives in the 15th century. Despite this, Columbus was long hailed as a hero to the west, with a national holiday bestowed in his honor.  \\u201cFor many people in our community, the statue represents patriarchy, oppression and divisiveness. That does not represent our great city, and we will no longer live in the shadow of our ugly past,\\u201d Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther wrote in a statement. \\u201cNow is the right time to replace this statue with artwork that demonstrates our enduring fight to end racism and celebrate the themes of diversity and inclusion.\\u201d  A number of residents responded to Ginther in opposition to removing the statue, citing that the statue represents the city's and country's history.\",\n          \"District of Columbia Republican Primary Live Election Results 2024\\nThe expected vote is the total number of votes that are expected in a given race once all votes are counted.

She never liked them.\\u201d This message is conveyed to me thirdhand, via the guy who ran the small Detroit label that put out the first White Stripes seven-inches back in 1998, who has spoken with the band\\u2019s extremely introverted drummer\\u2019s close friend, who apparently has delivered my request to the woman herself. After roughly three years of persistent (yet respectful) inquiry into whether Meg White might be open to talking about her legacy, I\\u2019ve inched closer to the inner sanctum. Plus, I\\u2019m told, she\\u2019s agreed to give my plea \\u201csome more thought.\\u201d It\\u2019s thrilling, to say the least.  That said, the content of this most recent response is by no means privileged. Meg\\u2019s discomfort with interviews is widely known. A few months ago, before the search results under her name were flooded with tributes defending her minimal drumming style against a critical tweet, one of the first links to come up was a YouTube video titled 15 Minutes of Meg White.  \\u201cI\\u2019m quiet. What can I say?\\u201d she\\u2019s seen asking at the 1:19-minute mark, in footage pulled from The White Stripes Under Great White Northern Lights, a documentary film that chronicled the band\\u2019s 2007 tour of every province in Canada. Less than a minute later, she can be seen squirming in her seat across from Charlie Rose, eyes down, whispering a fear of having accidentally cursed (she had not).  Twenty years after the release of Elephant, The White Stripes\\u2019 breakout album, the impact of the duo\\u2019s drummer is coming into focus. PATRICK PANTANO  For those unfamiliar with The White Stripes\\u2019 origins and trajectory, here\\u2019s a crash course: In the mid- to late 1990s, Jack White asks his then-wife, Meg, to drum a simple beat in their Detroit attic while he plays guitar, sparking creative lightning. The duo plays a few shows around town, records a couple of albums, heads out of town for a few tours, and then divorces in 2000.  Next, they start referring to themselves as brother and sister, record four more studio albums (two of which reach gold status; the other two, platinum), collect four Grammys, and land three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They appear on countless magazine covers, and Meg is tapped by Marc Jacobs for a 2006 campaign, shot by Juergen Teller.  And then, on July 31, 2007, following a celebratory toast before the last show of a series of Southern U.S. tour dates, Meg confides to Ben Blackwell, Jack\\u2019s nephew and the band\\u2019s official archivist, that he\\u2019s about to see the final White Stripes show. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018Oh, you mean of this leg?\\u2019\\u201d Blackwell recalls now. \\u201cAnd she said, \\u2018No, I think this is the last one,\\u2019 and just walked away.\\u201d    Later, a statement from the band would announce the cancellation of their fall U.S. tour due to Meg\\u2019s acute anxiety. While today, the practice of scrapping tour stops to prioritize mental health has become somewhat commonplace, in the mid-aughts, it felt quietly revolutionary. By 2011, The White Stripes would officially call it a day, stating that the end of the band was \\u201cnot due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue, nor any health issues as both Meg and Jack are feeling fine and in good health. It is for a myriad of reasons, but mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.\\u201d  This content is imported from youTube.

Watch on YouTube Icon YouTube Icon  Jack, of course, would continue performing, with the Raconteurs and Dead Weather, and as a solo artist. He\\u2019d also expand his Third Man Records enterprise, opening additional stores, a vinyl-pressing plant, and a bar. But aside from a brief White Stripes performance for the last episode of Late Night With Conan O\\u2019Brien in 2009, Meg would disappear from public life. In a 2014 Rolling Stone story, Jack expressed frustration over Meg\\u2019s hermit-like existence, but admitted \\u201call the not talking didn\\u2019t matter, because onstage? Nothing I do will top that.\\u201d  This past February, when the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame listed the duo among its annual nominees for induction, it seemed that finally the world had come around to realizing what Jack knew all along. While they didn\\u2019t make the final list, getting nominated in their first year of eligibility solidified one thing: The White Stripes have reentered the chat. And I figured, maybe, just maybe, awash in a sea of long-overdue accolades, Meg might finally agree to talk to me.  White at the hometown release show for De Stijl in 2000. DOUG COOMBE  In a way, I\\u2019ve been trying to get Meg to talk for more than two decades. As The White Stripes were getting ready to release their third album, White Blood Cells, in 2001, I was the staff music writer for an alt-weekly in Detroit who was assigned a cover story on the band. On couches inside the home whose attic had birthed their band, we talked about their growing influence outside the city, and how the name of the album represented \\u201cthis idea of bacteria coming at us\\u2014or just foreign things coming at us, or media, or attention on the band,\\u201d Jack told me then. When the story came out, the most common feedback I received from readers was that it was the first White Stripes story they\\u2019d seen that had featured more than one quote from Meg.    Two of The White Stripes\\u2019 early seven-inch releases. Don Penny  While she had a reputation around town for being reticent, Meg was fully engaged when we talked, telling me about the sweet gifts she\\u2019d received from fans and almost tearing up while watching a video an elementary school teacher had sent of her class singing \\u201cApple Blossom.\\u201d I also vaguely recall Meg wearing a lavender tank top, which felt diametrically opposed to the band\\u2019s strict color scheme of red, white, and black.    Before White Blood Cells, the band had been, for the most part, an underground secret. Dave Buick (who ran the local label that put out the first White Stripes seven-inches) recalls being among only a handful of witnesses to their earliest shows, since \\u201calmost everybody was outside smoking.\\u201d    In 1999, following the release of their self-titled debut album by a California-based independent punk and garage label, the band landed a three-show opening gig with indie-rock stalwarts Pavement. Scott Kannberg (a.k.a. Spiral Stairs), Pavement\\u2019s guitarist and occasional vocalist, recalls his band\\u2019s bassist coming backstage while Jack and Meg were playing, and telling everyone that they needed to go watch. \\u201cHe was like, \\u2018It\\u2019s like a young Robert Plant singing these blues songs, and his wife is drumming!\\u2019\\u201d  We all knew that first night that they would be famous.\\u201d\\u2014Corin Tucker  Corin Tucker, whose band Sleater-Kinney took the Stripes on tour with them a year later, describes being \\u201cfloored\\u201d the first night. \\u201cThey had an insane chemistry, and Meg\\u2019s playing was incredibly instinctual, hypnotic, and unique,\\u201d she says. \\u201cFrankly, they were a tough act to follow. We all knew that first night that they would be famous.\\u201d (Five years later, the prediction materialized when the band invited Sleater-Kinney to open for them at Washington\\u2019s Gorge Amphitheatre.)    Lizzy Goodman, who covered New York\\u2019s aughts rock revival and the scene that would later be referred to as \\u201cindie sleaze,\\u201d initially saw the White Stripes as just one of many \\u201cvery cool, very self-stylized, rad garage-rock duos\\u201d populating dive bars around the country. \\u201cBut when White Blood Cells came out, we were like, \\u2018Wait, what? Hang on. I think they might be geniuses.\\u201d  Buttons from the band\\u2019s White Blood Cells tour. Don Penny  On that album\\u2019s tour, she saw the band play at Philadelphia\\u2019s Trocadero Theatre. \\u201cI was standing in the balcony, and I vividly remember the power of that guitar sound,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt felt scary in the way that you want music to\\u2014like titillating, animating, but also sort of like, is it safe to be this excited? And there was something about the dynamic between the two of them: Like, here\\u2019s this guy who is just this unleashed force of nature, and then here\\u2019s this small, feminine woman playing the bro-iest of instruments, and she seems to somehow be in charge, like she\\u2019s a conductor or something.\\u201d    The 2003 release of Elephant, which included \\u201cSeven Nation Army,\\u201d a song whose opening riff riles up sports fans to this day, would send the band hurtling into the mainstream. Pavement\\u2019s Kannberg recalls catching a White Stripes show at the Seahawks Stadium Exhibition Center in Seattle that same year. Backstage, he says, \\u201cthey were just sitting by themselves, smoking cigarettes. Maybe it was just nerves from having to perform in front of, you know, 10,000 people, but they looked kind of miserable. They were like, \\u2018Spiral, rescue us!\\u2019\\u201d    Jack and Meg\\u2019s friends back home also noticed their growing unease with fame. \\u201cI never really talked to Meg about it, but as their career went on, you could sense she was having a hard time dealing with the celebrity part of it. I mean, I don\\u2019t think I could deal with it either,\\u201d Buick says.    This content is imported from youTube.

Watch on YouTube Icon YouTube Icon  The White Stripes were being heralded as a raw return to rock in an era of airbrushed pop. But Meg\\u2019s indie cred did not make her immune to the casual misogyny and rampant objectification lobbed at her more polished peers. (At one point, a risqu\\u00e9 video supposedly featuring Meg\\u2014but which turned out to be fake\\u2014circulated among the more disturbing music blogs.) Goodman calls it the \\u201ccultural default settings\\u201d of the music scene in the early-to-mid 2000s. \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna say all, but most of the men who behaved in a shitty way toward me back then don\\u2019t even know it,\\u201d she says. \\u201cImagine what Meg White dealt with. I just can\\u2019t even.\\u201d    In a somewhat full circle moment, Blackwell, who manned the White Stripes email list in the early days, and who would later shadow me at work while he studied journalism at Detroit\\u2019s Wayne State University, emails to let me know Meg White is trending on Twitter. Apparently a politics reporter had responded to a tweet from National Review linking to an article praising \\u201cSeven Nation Army\\u201d by stating that \\u201cthe tragedy of the White Stripes is how great they would\\u2019ve been with a half decent drummer.\\u201d  \\u201cDon\\u2019t get me started,\\u201d says Kid Congo Powers of legendary bands like the Gun Club and the Cramps. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just sexist. People have been saying the whole time that her drumming was simplistic, but the band was just guitar and drums. The music they\\u2019re mining is simple music, and she\\u2019s playing it exactly right and exactly great.\\u201d  To Powers\\u2019 point, the reporter\\u2019s sentiment was nearly identical to a conversation I\\u2019d overheard in the production room of the Detroit alt-weekly as we were working on my White Stripes cover story over 20 years ago. Since social media hadn\\u2019t yet been invented, all I could do then was roll my eyes. But in 2023, the reporter\\u2019s tweet was swiftly pounced on by everyone from Questlove to model-musician Karen Elson, who concluded a supportive response with \\u201ckeep my ex husband\\u2019s ex wife\\u2019s name out of your f*cking mouth.\\u201d  This content is imported from twitter.

Meg\\u2019s heard that her entire career, and it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m sorry, if you\\u2019ve ever seen them live, it\\u2019s not so much about anything other than how these two people sound together. Here is a woman who is one half of a landmark, era-defining rock band. How much more deserving does she have to fucking be? When The White Stripes came down the pike, you could see it\\u2014nine months, a year later\\u2014so many more women, more teenage girls, were playing drums.\\u201d    In 2003, Karissa Talanian was 12 years old and \\u201cone of, like, four other weirdos who cared about listening to music more than paying attention in class\\u201d in her small central Massachusetts town. One day, her mom brought home a copy of De Stijl, the White Stripes\\u2019 then three-year-old sophomore album, and it changed her life.  Her aunt and uncle took her to one of the band\\u2019s shows at the Boston Opera House a few years later. \\u201cI was hyperventilating the whole time,\\u201d Talanian says. She went home and found a list of every band that had ever played with The White Stripes and added them all on Myspace. Eventually, she taught herself to play the drums along with Meg\\u2019s beats. Today, she plays the instrument in a band called Plum, books shows at a venue in her current hometown of Chicago, and runs an independent cassette label called Eye Vybe Records.  Four years ago, through the Myspace friendships she\\u2019d developed over time, Talanian found herself backstage at a Raconteurs show. \\u201cI wound up in this super dark room, and Meg was there and all these other people I kind of knew,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWhen I met her, I played it super cool.\\u201d They ended up talking for hours, about their dogs and how great Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham was.  Talanian and I talked days before the tweet involving Meg went viral, but one of the last things she said to me felt awfully prescient: \\u201cI can\\u2019t speculate at all, and I feel weird even saying it, but maybe if she hadn\\u2019t had such harsh feedback all the time, maybe The White Stripes wouldn\\u2019t have ended.\\u201d  This content is imported from youTube.

I think she\\u2019s one of the best drummers of our time.\\u201d\\u2014Olivia Rodrigo  \\u201cMeg\\u2019s drumming and The White Stripes in general [provided] a huge lesson to me on the value of simplicity in music. They taught me that a truly great song doesn\\u2019t need to have crazy production or layers of sound. It just needs to move you. You can sense her passion in every song she plays, and it\\u2019s so special. I think she\\u2019s one of the best drummers of our time.\\u201d    At long last, I get Meg\\u2019s friend on the line. She asks not to be named in this story, but assures me that Meg is fine and that she\\u2019s human, and as such has good days and bad days. To further ease my mind, she adds that Meg eats a Honeycrisp apple every day to keep the doctor away. \\u201cShe spent 15 years traveling and touring and playing. It\\u2019s not that odd to think that she just likes to be home,\\u201d she tells me. I also learn that Meg is aware of her viral moment, and that her response was something along the lines of \\u201coh, that again?\\u201d I ask if it might be okay to send some questions for Meg over text. She tells me to send whatever I want and that she\\u2019ll pass it along.  A few days later, Blackwell, who in addition to his archivist duties is also a co-founder and co-owner of Third Man Records, consoles me with the fact that he also tried and failed to get Meg to do an interview a couple of years ago timed to the 20th anniversary of the band\\u2019s debut album. \\u201cOn the one hand, the journalism dropout in me feels that. I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Yeah, she needs to talk,\\u2019\\u201d Blackwell says. \\u201cBut on the other hand, God, it\\u2019s so much fucking cooler that she doesn\\u2019t. It\\u2019s not like she\\u2019s living on a tropical island and no one sees or talks to her or anything like that. But her current operational way forward\\u2014this media blackout\\u2014is fucking badass, and it\\u2019s rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll.\\u201d  She really does walk to the beat of her own drum.\\u201d\\u2014Lizzy Goodman  Goodman, who is very much not a journalism dropout (and whose 2017 oral history book, Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001\\u20132011, was recently adapted into a documentary), agrees. \\u201cI think what I respect the most about Meg White is that it just doesn\\u2019t seem like she has any interest in whether you or I or anyone else understands her at all. She really does walk to the beat of her own drum. And doing that in life in general is difficult. But doing it when you have been as famous as she has, and have gotten used to people telling you how great you are\\u2014it\\u2019s just very hard to walk away from that.\\u201d    This content is imported from youTube.

Watch on YouTube Icon YouTube Icon  By this point, I\\u2019ve pretty much come to terms with the fact that I may never know what makes Meg White tick, other than what I\\u2019ve projected upon her as a fellow shy person and interminable mumbler\\u2014albeit one who unfortunately did not achieve a level of success in my twenties and thirties allowing me to not leave my house.  But I take solace in something Buick witnessed at a 2018 Detroit arena show Jack White played while promoting his third solo album. At one point during the show, he spotted Meg sitting by the side of the stage. As she listened to Jack\\u2019s new band play an old White Stripes song, \\u201cshe was like, really, really getting into it,\\u201d Buick tells me. \\u201cLike, kind of drumming along, like a spark might be sparking. Hopefully someday we\\u2019ll see her back behind a drum kit.\\u201d  The day after my deadline, I receive a text from Meg\\u2019s friend. She apologizes for not getting back to me sooner, and confirms that Meg has declined to answer the questions I\\u2019d texted because it\\u2019s still technically an interview, and she\\u2019s said \\u201cno\\u201d to so many that she can\\u2019t start saying \\u201cyes\\u201d now. I thank her, tell her I understand, and ask her to do something that suddenly seems very important, which is to send Meg my best.
