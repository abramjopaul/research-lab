Don\\u2019t they provide much-needed support?      T: Not really. I can walk around all day with a bra and without a bra and feel completely fine. Even working out doesn\\u2019t bother me!      Well, sorry for noticing, but you have extremely small breasts. Don\\u2019t you think that\\u2019s why you might not need the extra support?      T: Well maybe, but I\\u2019m no scientist. All I know is that without that constricting band going around me I feel so much better. And my nipples are always hard so I\\u2019m getting a lot more attention than before!      Now what do you say to the women who might have significantly bigger breasts than you do? Should they still adopt your ideals?      T: Absolutely!

Stuffed in its pockets was a stack of unchecked lottery tickets.  \\u201cI always told myself, \\u2018I\\u2019ll check them when I have the time,\\u2019\\u201d the New Jersey man said.  It\\u2019s a good thing he did. Because had he waited two days longer, he\\u2019d have lost out on $24.1 million.  \\u2018Check your pockets. Check your glove box\\u2019  More than a year ago, Smith bought a ticket to the New York Lotto.  The winning numbers for the May 25, 2016 drawing were: 05 - 12 - 13 - 22 - 25 - 35.  The New York Gaming Commission knew the winning ticket, worth $24.1 million, was sold at a bodega in New York City \\u2013 but it didn\\u2019t know who bought the ticket.  Winners have a year to claim the prize and that expiration day was quickly approaching.  So earlier this year, the New York Lottery started to get the word out.  \\u201cWe urge New York Lottery players: Check your pockets. Check your glove box. Look under the couch cushions. If you have this winning ticket, we look forward to meeting you,\\u201d Gweneth Dean, director of the Commission\\u2019s Division of the Lottery, said at the time.  Play #LOTTO, been to TriBeCa? Check your tickets to see if you\\u2019re a $24M winner! Your winnings expire on 5/25/17! https://t.co/jMAy3GYlmi pic.twitter.com/qtC0tJcS4c \\u2014 New York Lottery (@newyorklottery) May 19, 2017  \\u2018Do I see what I think I see?\\u2019  Smith, a retired security officer, caught a news story about the search for the mystery winner. That inspired him to check his old tickets.  He went up to the closet where the old shirt hung.  When the numbers matched up, he \\u201cstood there for a minute thinking, \\u2018Do I see what I think I see?\\u2019\\u201d  \\u201cI had to stick my head out the window and breathe in some fresh air,: he said. \\u201cI was in serious doubt. I really had to convince myself this was real.\\u201d  \\u201cAll-family discussion\\u201d  That was on May 23, 2017. He\\u2019d have been ineligible to collect after May 25, 2017.  On Wednesday, the New York Lottery released Smith\\u2019s name after completing a review.  \\u201cWe are thrilled that this lucky winner was able to locate this life-changing ticket,\\u201d Dean, of the gaming commission, said.  Smith chose to receive his payments over the course of 26 years.  A father of two and grandfather of 12, he said he plans to have an \\u201call-family discussion\\u201d once things settle down.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1110,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2019-04-11 07:52:00\",\n          \"2023-03-27 17:30:00.373000+00:00\",\n          \"2023-01-17\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"True\",\n          \"satire\",\n          \"misleading content\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"vicuna\",\n          \"UpliftingNews\",\n          \"savedyouaclick\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 27398.985296747516,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 176754.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1158,\n        \"samples\": [\n          375.0,\n          4693.0,\n          1195.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ratio\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04982994002125025,\n        \"min\": 0.63,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.74,\n          0.85,\n          0.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["\n","# Load dataset\n","df_org = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/LLM Research Lab/dataset/dataset-2344.csv')\n","df_org.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["category_mapping = {\n","    'True': 0,\n","    'satire': 1,\n","    'misleading content': 2,\n","    'imposter content': 3\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"da-PvYviSOca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720209419536,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}}},"id":"da-PvYviSOca","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_input= pd.DataFrame()\n","df_input['content'] = df_org['title'] + '\\n'  + df_org['content']\n","df_input['category'] = df_org['category'].map(category_mapping)\n","df_input.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"Giy-AJKaAy6d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720209419537,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Abram Jopaul","userId":"17786227485365934682"}},"outputId":"d4f6c1f7-9f73-4125-fa64-da103d2620b9"},"id":"Giy-AJKaAy6d","execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                             content  category\n","0  STOP EVERYTHING!

Ironically, she was being honored for trying to change that.  The 33-year-old London-based physicist has become something of a phenomenon herself \\u2014 both an irresistible force and immoveable object \\u2014 in her very personal campaign to bring more girls to study and work in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).  Wade has written more than 1,600 Wikipedia entries for long-ignored women scientists, and she has firm beliefs on ideas on how to support girls interested in the field.  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  Wade gained notice when, still in her 20s, she began writing the Wikipedia biographies about women and minority scientists who never got their due \\u2014 from employers, from other scientists, from the public.  As her Wikipedia entries climbed into the dozens, and then into the hundreds, she spoke and wrote more on gender equality in science. She won awards and medals and was cited by Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia.  However, not all of Wiki-world was happy with her. Several of her entries were deleted by other Wikimedians, as the most influential contributors and editors are called. She told TODAY.com that they said a handful of the women she wrote up were not all that well-known.  Wade said that\\u2019s right, that\\u2019s the problem: they should be better known.  One example was Clarice Phelps. Wade heard about the young African-American nuclear chemist, and wrote a Wikipedia bio describing her work on a team that discovered a new periodic-table element at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The Phelps entry bounced on and off Wikipedia as critics deleted it and Wade defended it. In the end, Wade won, and Phelps\\u2019 entry is back on Wikipedia for good.  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  Meanwhile, Wade\\u2019s own Wikipedia entry \\u2014 written by others, not her \\u2014 has grown to 10 printed pages.  As Wade pursues her effort to make sure women scientists are known, she also has beliefs on how to make sure the next generation gets the support they need.  She said girls don\\u2019t need \\u201cwhiz-bang\\u201d experiments at school assemblies: visiting scientists do their show, pack up, depart and nothing changes. Instead, girls and students of color need to be coached and mentored on what to study, and when.  \\u201cPeople assume girls don\\u2019t choose science because they\\u2019re not inspired,\\u201d Wade, 33, said in a recent interview. \\u201cGirls are already interested. It\\u2019s more about making students aware of the different careers in science and getting parents and teachers on board.\\u201d  Women make up only 28 percent of the U.S. work force in STEM, according to the American Association of University Women, and only one in five current engineering or computer science majors are women. Women in STEM earn $60,000 a year, compared to $85,000 for men, according to the American Association of University Women, a non-profit organization that focuses on equity for women.  \\u201cUltimately, we don\\u2019t only need to increase the number of girls choosing science, we need to increase the proportion of women who stay in science,\\u201d said Wade, whose doctorate research at Imperial College in London has been widely cited for advances in digital display technology for TV, computer and phone screens.  One key, she said, is better high school science teachers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re suffering a huge shortage of skills-specialist science teachers across the U.S. and the U.K.,\\u201d she said.  Wade said schools should make it easier for girls and students of color to apply for admissions, grants, fellowships and promotions.  \\u201cWhat do you need to do? Who do you need to speak to? When do you need to make that application? Who should be your cheerleader or supporter?\\u201d  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  She believes schools need to be upfront about their policies on bullying and sexual harassment; universities must provide affordable child care on campus; and conference organizers should provide day care and grants for those with caring responsibilities.  Wade, who grew up the daughter of two physicians and had supportive teachers at private schools, realized at a young age that most people were not as lucky.  \\u201cI genuinely believe that science is better when it\\u2019s done by diverse teams,\\u201d she said.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s also important because we\\u2019re designing new technologies or new scientific solutions to global problems, we want the teams of people creating them to reflect the societies that they\\u2019re serving.\\u201d  \\u201cEven if you don\\u2019t care about any of that, the world desperately needs more scientists and engineers,\\u201d Wade added. \\u201cScience can help solve the world\\u2019s biggest challenges \\u2014 climate change, antibiotic resistance, emerging pandemic-inducing viruses.\\u201d  Looking back on her inclusion in the late Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s 2019 Birthday Honours list, Wade hopes young women scientists will become commonplace at future ceremonies.  And she hopes they will enjoy it as much as she did.  \\u201cIt was pretty wild to be honored by the royal family,\\u201d Wade recalled. She didn\\u2019t meet the queen, but she did take along her mother, Dr. Charlotte Feinmann, to Buckingham Palace.  Her father, Dr. John Wade, couldn\\u2019t attend, but Jess Wade did her best to make it up to him.  \\u201cI took a Tupperware,\\u201d she confided, \\u201cto sneak some royal sandwiches home to my dad.\\u201d\",\n          \"Biden Calls Xi Jinping A Dictator And A Slut\\nSAN FRANCISCO\\u2014Speaking at a solo press conference after a carefully orchestrated diplomatic summit with the Chinese leader, President Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday that he still thought Xi Jinping was a dictator and a slut. \\u201cLook, there\\u2019s nothing that happened in this summit that changed my belief that Xi rules his country with an iron fist and has also been around the block with everyone\\u2014like, seriously, everyone,\\u201d said Biden, denouncing the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party for his authoritarian measures toward his own citizens and claiming he heard a rumor that Xi once had to have his stomach pumped because he had swallowed over a gallon of semen. \\u201cThis is not a good guy we\\u2019re talking about here, people. Also, he\\u2019s not even that hot. That\\u2019s the thing. He\\u2019s just this fugly little skank. Plus, what he\\u2019s doing to the Uyghur people is abhorrent. Almost as abhorrent as Xi blowing any and all takers.\\u201d At press time, Beijing had immediately condemned the statement, remarking that the Chinese president\\u2019s body count was, like, two at most.

An awesome new theory claims that Harry\\u2019s methods for coming back from the dead after defeating Voldermort might have granted him eternal life. And it\\u2019s all thanks to Fawkes the phoenix being a secret horcrux.  Tumblr user marauders4evr\\u2019s theory is this: when Harry killed the Basilisk in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, a part of his soul flew out and was looking to attach itself to something. Harry was fatally injured by the Basilisk\\u2019s venom, but Fawkes the phoenix swooped in, perched on his arm, and saved the day by shedding a few tears. Harry lived to fight Voldemort another day, and, possibly, that bit of his soul flying around attached itself to Fawkes, making Harry essentially immortal.  Tumblr  But wait, horcruxes don\\u2019t make people immortal \\u2014 not really. Yes, but when a phoenix dies it turns to ash, and then is reborn from the ashes. Phoenixes don\\u2019t die. If a part of Harry\\u2019s soul is going to live forever inside a phoenix, then that part of his soul will never die. Basically, Harry Potter is immortal!  It also explains how Harry managed to come back from the dead after defeating Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, since Rowling never really totally explained that bit. If Harry\\u2019s soul was still intact somewhere else (like inside Fawkes, for example), then it would have been relatively simple for him to come back from the dead.  mtv.com  There are all kinds of other theories for how Harry came back to life. One is that he wasn\\u2019t dead at all in the first place because the only part of his soul that was destroyed was really Voldemort\\u2019s soul inside of him. Or, he\\u2019d come in contact with all three of the Deathly Hallows, which made him the Master of Death. Or maybe that the Mirror of Erised is, actually, Harry\\u2019s horcrux. You get it. But Rowling has said that she wrote Harry\\u2019s \\u201cdeath scene\\u201d so that it was up for interpretation.  So, if Harry Potter is fucking immortal, then he could accomplish anything. He could unite the muggle and magical worlds. He could go back in time and rename one of his kids after Hagrid like he should have in the first place. He could possibly go a little power-hungry (if Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is to be believed).  theodysseyonline  If he\\u2019s around for a while, he might become a little obsessed with making the world a better place, and we all know that immortality rarely turns out to be a good thing. And what villain in the Harry Potter world do we know of that was obsessed with making the world a \\u201cbetter place,\\u201d come hell or high water?  Here\\u2019s hoping Harry doesn\\u2019t become the very thing he set out to destroy in the first place.\",\n          \"Dying Gazans Criticized For Not Using Last Words To Condemn Hamas\\nGAZA CITY, GAZA\\u2014The complicity of each and every Palestinian in the violent actions of their militant ruling authority was reportedly on full display Friday morning when dying Gazans received justified criticism for not using their last words to condemn Hamas. For example, instead of issuing a full-throated denunciation of the violent attacks by Hamas that have left over 1,300 Israelis dead, one dying woman holding her 6-year-old son who had just been killed in a bombing is said to have doubled down by telling her child she loved him. According to reports, such barbarism on the part of Palestinians was on full display across the Gaza Strip, where many men of fighting age could not muster a single world of reproof for Hamas\\u2019 actions while they coughed up blood. In war-ravaged Gaza City, a dying reporter was heard blatantly begging for help instead of labeling Hamas a terrorist organization. At press time, the Israeli Defense Forces Twitter account underscored the massive surge of contempt they were contending with by posting a video that featured the shocking savagery of a Palestinian corpse that refused to condemn Hamas even when kicked.

An awesome new theory claims that Harry\\u2019s methods for coming back from the dead after defeating Voldermort might have granted him eternal life. And it\\u2019s all thanks to Fawkes the phoenix being a secret horcrux.  Tumblr user marauders4evr\\u2019s theory is this: when Harry killed the Basilisk in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, a part of his soul flew out and was looking to attach itself to something. Harry was fatally injured by the Basilisk\\u2019s venom, but Fawkes the phoenix swooped in, perched on his arm, and saved the day by shedding a few tears. Harry lived to fight Voldemort another day, and, possibly, that bit of his soul flying around attached itself to Fawkes, making Harry essentially immortal.  Tumblr  But wait, horcruxes don\\u2019t make people immortal \\u2014 not really. Yes, but when a phoenix dies it turns to ash, and then is reborn from the ashes. Phoenixes don\\u2019t die. If a part of Harry\\u2019s soul is going to live forever inside a phoenix, then that part of his soul will never die. Basically, Harry Potter is immortal!  It also explains how Harry managed to come back from the dead after defeating Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, since Rowling never really totally explained that bit. If Harry\\u2019s soul was still intact somewhere else (like inside Fawkes, for example), then it would have been relatively simple for him to come back from the dead.  mtv.com  There are all kinds of other theories for how Harry came back to life. One is that he wasn\\u2019t dead at all in the first place because the only part of his soul that was destroyed was really Voldemort\\u2019s soul inside of him. Or, he\\u2019d come in contact with all three of the Deathly Hallows, which made him the Master of Death. Or maybe that the Mirror of Erised is, actually, Harry\\u2019s horcrux. You get it. But Rowling has said that she wrote Harry\\u2019s \\u201cdeath scene\\u201d so that it was up for interpretation.  So, if Harry Potter is fucking immortal, then he could accomplish anything. He could unite the muggle and magical worlds. He could go back in time and rename one of his kids after Hagrid like he should have in the first place. He could possibly go a little power-hungry (if Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is to be believed).  theodysseyonline  If he\\u2019s around for a while, he might become a little obsessed with making the world a better place, and we all know that immortality rarely turns out to be a good thing. And what villain in the Harry Potter world do we know of that was obsessed with making the world a \\u201cbetter place,\\u201d come hell or high water?  Here\\u2019s hoping Harry doesn\\u2019t become the very thing he set out to destroy in the first place.\",\n          \"Dying Gazans Criticized For Not Using Last Words To Condemn Hamas\\nGAZA CITY, GAZA\\u2014The complicity of each and every Palestinian in the violent actions of their militant ruling authority was reportedly on full display Friday morning when dying Gazans received justified criticism for not using their last words to condemn Hamas. For example, instead of issuing a full-throated denunciation of the violent attacks by Hamas that have left over 1,300 Israelis dead, one dying woman holding her 6-year-old son who had just been killed in a bombing is said to have doubled down by telling her child she loved him. According to reports, such barbarism on the part of Palestinians was on full display across the Gaza Strip, where many men of fighting age could not muster a single world of reproof for Hamas\\u2019 actions while they coughed up blood. In war-ravaged Gaza City, a dying reporter was heard blatantly begging for help instead of labeling Hamas a terrorist organization. At press time, the Israeli Defense Forces Twitter account underscored the massive surge of contempt they were contending with by posting a video that featured the shocking savagery of a Palestinian corpse that refused to condemn Hamas even when kicked.
