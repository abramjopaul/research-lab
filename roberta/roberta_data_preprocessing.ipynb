Contraception including the pill, IUDs, contraceptive patches and other methods will be free for women aged 25 and under in France from January 1, 2021.  Advertising Read more  The scheme, which could benefit three million women, covers the pill, IUDs, contraceptive patches and other methods composed of steroid hormones.  Contraception for minors was already free in France. Several European countries, including Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway, make contraception free for teens.  Britain makes several forms of contraception free to all.  France announced the extension to women under 25 in September, saying surveys showed a decline in the use of contraception mainly for financial reasons.  The move is part of a series of measures taken by President Emmanuel Macron's government to boost women's rights and alleviate youth poverty.  The free provision is supported by women's groups including the association En Avant Tous.  \\\"Between 18 and 25-years-old, women are very vulnerable because they lose a lot of rights compared to when they were minors and are very precarious economically,\\\" spokeswoman Louise Delavier told AFP.  Leslie Fonquerne, an expert in gender issues, said there was more to be done.  \\\"This measure in no way resolves the imbalance in the contraceptive burden between women and men,\\\" the sociologist said.  In some developed countries, the free contraception won by women after decades of campaigning is coming under attack again from the religious right.  In the United States, former president Barack Obama's signature health reform, known as Obamacare, gave most people with health insurance free access to birth control.  But his successor Donald Trump scrapped the measure, allowing employers to opt out of providing contraception coverage on religious grounds -- a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in 2020.  Poland's conservative government has also heavily restricted access to emergency contraception as part of its war on birth control.

At the age of 26, Debra gave birth to twin daughters, and after a while she knew something was off. She realized she didn\\u2019t actually want kids after all, so she packed her things and left the kids with her husband. She\\u2019s never seen or spoken to any of them since.  \\u201cNormally being a deadbeat is associated with men, and when women do it we usually get weird looks.\\u201d Debra explained to reporters. \\u201cI want to show the world that us women can abandon our children just as good if not better than men.\\u201d  Debra went on to say that she plans on doing everything a man usually does when they abandon their children, including refusing to pay child support, and by telling her children when they get older that her husband wouldn\\u2019t allow her to see them.\",\n          \"pt 7 2022  A heated debate is ongoing between nutrition advocates and food industry groups regarding the potential harm of placing additional labels on the front of packaged foods The upcoming White House

question the lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of these labels They argue that the voluntary labeling programs already in place provide sufficient information to consumers These

documents stolen from george w. bush. his first reaction was to turn them over to the fbi.  in his interview with george stephanopoulos on wednesday, president donald trump tried to imagine a scenario in which someone involved with a presidential campaign would call the fbi if that person was offered dirt from a foreign government on the opposition.  \\u201cokay, let\\u2019s put yourself in a position,\\u201d the president begins. \\u201cyou\\u2019re a congressman. somebody comes up and says, \\u2018hey, i have information on your opponent.\\u2019 do you call the fbi? \\u2026 you don\\u2019t call the fbi.    \\u201clife doesn\\u2019t work that way,\\u201d trump added.  in 2000, life did work that way for tom downey, a former democratic representative from new york who was helping his friend, vice president al gore, run for the white house. downey, who had served in the house for 18 years until becoming a lobbyist in 1993, had been preparing to play gore\\u2019s opponent, george w. bush, in the presidential debates when, in mid-september, he received a package in the mail. it contained briefing materials and a videotape. when downey started watching the tape, along with his assistant, he quickly realized it was a video of bush practicing as if he were being interviewed by tim russert, the late meet the press host who was a contender to moderate the first debate.  \\u201ci remember watching the video thinking, uh-oh, we shouldn\\u2019t have this,\\u201d downey, now 70, told me in a phone interview on thursday. \\u201ci got up and turned it off. i didn\\u2019t rewind it.\\u201d  he immediately called his lawyer. \\u201ci handed him the material and said, \\u2018let\\u2019s just turn this stuff over to the fbi,\\u2019\\u201d downey recalled. within 90 minutes of receiving the package, he said, it was out of his possession.  the package didn\\u2019t come from a foreign government, but from an employee of a media firm contracted by bush\\u2019s campaign. it contained both the tape and more than 120 pages of debate prep and strategy documents kept by mark mckinnon, then a bush adviser. the fbi investigation that ensued led to the arrest of juanita yvette lozano, who ultimately was sentenced to a year in prison for mail fraud and perjury.  downey didn\\u2019t just turn over the package to federal authorities; he recused himself from the campaign, forcing gore to find a new sparring partner (the former bill clinton strategist paul begala) just weeks before the first contest. the debates went poorly for gore, and he went on to lose the closest presidential election in more than a century.  when i first caught downey on the phone on thursday morning, i asked him whether, after all that\\u2019s happened since, he still thinks he made the right decision. he laughed. \\u201cyes,\\u201d he said. but he added: \\u201cafter eight years of the bush presidency, i sometimes question that myself.\\u201d  later, during our interview, he was more reflective. he said he wondered about what would have happened if he had kept the material and if the bush campaign had discovered it had been stolen. \\u201chow do you answer the question: why did you keep it?\\u201d downey said.  i spoke with downey about his experience in 2000, his view of the president\\u2019s attitude toward foreign election interference, and whether he thought the tom downey of 2020 would do the same thing. our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.  russell berman: so tell me what happened in 2000.  tom downey: in 2000, i was preparing to play bush, and i\\u2019d seen all his debates and tried to get his mannerisms down. on september 13, literally the day before we were going to do one of our mock debates, we get a package in the mail, and it contains all their debate materials\\u2014including videotapes of bush doing tim russert\\u2013style interviews. and i remember watching the video thinking, uh-oh, we shouldn\\u2019t have this. i got up and turned it off. i didn\\u2019t rewind it.  i called my lawyer, who was also my first administrative assistant and a good guy with good political judgment. i handed him the material and said, \\u201clet\\u2019s just turn this stuff over to the fbi.\\u201d  the fbi eventually came and interviewed me. i remember it was pretty funny, because i had to explain what the crime was to them. you\\u2019d think they would have had this down. ultimately, the fbi agent [leading the investigation] was louis freeh, the director of the fbi. so at one point they understood how important it was.  that same day, i called gore\\u2019s campaign manager, bill daley, and told him that i was going to recuse myself. in both our minds, this was an unpleasant situation. i just said, \\u201clook, no one\\u2019s going to believe i hadn\\u2019t read this stuff and learned from it, so i\\u2019m just going to recuse myself from the campaign.\\u201d it was hard to do, because (a) this was my friend running for president, and (b) i had bush pretty much down by then. but i didn\\u2019t talk to al until, actually, all of the debates were done. and the rest is history.  [downey then explained that, at the time, bush said that if he ever saw downey, he\\u2019d like to thank him for doing the right thing.]  ironically, like, two years later, i\\u2019m in prague. there\\u2019s a nato summit. i\\u2019m at a cocktail party and he\\u2019s there, and i walk over to him and say, \\u201cwell, mr. president, my name\\u2019s tom downey. i\\u2019ve been waiting two years for that handshake you wanted to give me.\\u201d and i thought he wouldn\\u2019t have any idea who i was, but he grabs my hand. he was talking to someone from the czech republic, someone from hungary, somebody from slovakia. their english was okay, but it wasn\\u2019t great. and bush tells them, \\u201che was me! he was me!\\u201d they don\\u2019t have a clue what he\\u2019s talking about. i was surprised and pleased. laura was there. he brought her over: \\u201cyou remember\\u2014he did that right thing of turning over the debate tapes.\\u201d he was going on and on and on. i thought it was very nice. i said to him, \\u201cyou know, mr. president, i spent 70 hours trying to be you.\\u201d and he goes, \\u201cthat must have been boring as hell.\\u201d  berman: did you recuse yourself from helping gore because you were worried about the perception that even though you had turned over the material, you still might have used it? or did you simply feel honor-bound, that it was the right thing to do?  downey: i thought a little bit of both, to be honest with you. i thought, look, this is a presidential election. presidential campaigns should act honorably, even though most politicians are not perceived as being honorable creatures. but that\\u2019s because they don\\u2019t act honorably. if you act honorably, people have a different attitude about politics. or, at least, they can expect some version of the truth in a debate without one side having seen the materials of the other.  and then i just had the cold-eyed worldview that some people are going to think, downey seems like an honorable guy, but i\\u2019m sure he read all this stuff, and i\\u2019m sure he watched it all. so rather than face that, i basically decided, i\\u2019m not going to have anything to do with this campaign.  i knew as soon as i saw the video that my role in the debates was over. a crime has been committed to get it to me. i\\u2019m in the process of involving myself in the furtherance of mail fraud. so it really wasn\\u2019t a hard decision.  berman: but by taking that extra step, you\\u2019re almost making yourself, or making the gore campaign, the victim of the crime instead of the bush campaign. the gore campaign ends up being disadvantaged, in a sense, because you had to step aside and you couldn\\u2019t help anymore.  downey: ironically, i was in fact the victim of a crime! i got paid to fly down to austin, texas, to appear before the grand jury. i kept saying to them, \\u201ci\\u2019m happy to pay for this. this is my responsibility as a citizen to appear before a grand jury.\\u201d and they said, \\u201coh no, you\\u2019re the victim of a crime.\\u201d i said, \\u201cwhat crime? they sent me the materials.\\u201d and they said, \\u201cyeah, that\\u2019s it.\\u201d  berman: did you believe, at the time, that if the same thing happened to the bush campaign, they would have done the same thing?  downey: the other question my staff had was, were we being set up? but i never thought for a minute that this was anything other than what it was. i never thought about whether they would have behaved the same way or not.  berman: how many other people in the campaign besides your lawyer did you tell about the package before you went to the fbi? did anyone say, \\u201clet\\u2019s use this\\u201d?  downey: looking back, we thought for a few minutes, but we had a pretty good idea that this had to go to the fbi. i did not have the materials in my possession for more than an hour and a half.  berman: and there was nobody in the small group of people who were looped in on this who said, \\u201chey, maybe we shouldn\\u2019t go to the fbi\\u201d?  downey: no.  i\\u2019ll tell you a funny story: i don\\u2019t want to mention his name, because it would somehow besmirch his memory, and i don\\u2019t want to do that. but chris dodd said one of his senate colleagues said to him, \\u201cyou\\u2019re friendly with tom. please tell me he read every page and made copies of all that.\\u201d and chris said to this guy, \\u201cuh, no.\\u201d  berman: so did you ever have any regrets about it, knowing how close the election was and everything that\\u2019s transpired since?  downey: that\\u2019s a good question. no. i mean, at the time, i thought we\\u2019d win. i thought it would be close.  looking back on it, you could make the case that they would have discovered that the book was missing, that during the first debate maybe they would have seen gore answer a question and then make an allegation that the materials had been stolen and used by the gore campaign. and then you wind up losing a close election because you decided to play fast and loose.  how do you answer the question: why did you keep it?  berman: given your rather unique vantage point, what\\u2019s been your reaction to everything that\\u2019s transpired over the last three years with trump and russia, and to the comments the president made to george stephanopoulos?  downey: the original trump tower meeting was a mistake, but the president said he didn\\u2019t participate in that. so it\\u2019s his son and his campaign making that decision.  but rather than having learned from that, trump himself says, \\u201cyeah, i\\u2019d have to look at it.\\u201d really? what part of \\u201cforeign interference is bad\\u201d don\\u2019t you understand? why do you disrespect the american people so much that you can\\u2019t even have an election that isn\\u2019t tipped by one side or the other?  when i was in congress, i served on the board of visitors for the military academies. and at west point, the cadets have an honor code, and it says a cadet shall not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. and i remember thinking, in this latest episode, well, if it\\u2019s good for the officer corps, why isn\\u2019t it good for the commander in chief? the fact is, the american people, who are the real losers here, overwhelmingly disagree with the idea that somehow you should use material from the russians or the chinese.  berman: do you think that because of trump\\u2019s actions and attitude, the tom downey of 2020\\u2014a campaign adviser in either party\\u2014would be more or less likely to do what you did?  downey: i would like to think that in any era we have our heroes and our villains, and i would much prefer to be the example to whatever future generation that it\\u2019s not hard to do the right thing. it\\u2019s the only thing to do, and you\\u2019d need to let the judgment of history determine whether you were right or wrong at the time. but doing the right thing is always the right thing.\",\n          \"dive into anything\\nreddit and its partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide you

dialed the only number she could remember\\u2026  dialing 911  shutterstock  she only knew this number because her mother had instructed her to memorize it in case of an emergency. she paused before responding as tears started to well up in her eyes. sophie told the operator, \\\"my mommy has been sleeping all day.\\u201d as she spoke into the phone, her heart was pounding with anxiety.  helping

her address. however, the police found that entering the apartment complex was more challenging than they had anticipated when they arrived.  stunned by what they saw  shutterstock  time seemed to pass by slowly for everyone involved. they soon became aware that they could only do one thing to enter the apartment. but when the police were finally allowed inside, they were horrified to see what they did.  what shocked the officers? what had sophie's mother been up to? and would she recover?  sophie loved her mother  shutterstock  only sophie and her mother hanna lived in the apartment. sophie was only four years old. sophie\\u2019s dad had never been in the picture. as soon as hanna informed him of her pregnancy, he left her to raise their daughter on her own. but she didn\\u2019t

recognized that today was different.  still in bed  shutterstock  as soon as sophie woke up, she noticed her mother was different. she could hardly open her eyes and wasn't her usual cheerful self. in her normal behavior, hanna would shut off the alarm on its first ring, but she had not moved a muscle since it went off. sophie got up to turn it off instead.  she wasn\\u2019t old enough to

minutes passed, sophie's mother remained in bed asleep. the tv was on, and sophie started watching her typical morning shows. but eventually she felt a growling in her stomach. what kept her mother

race. panic arose in her body, and tears started to well up in her eyes. she felt helpless and didn\\u2019t know what to do. but by now, she knew something strange was happening and she needed to find help.  she had to call someone  shutterstock  her mother had told her about a number she could call if something were wrong. she had no idea who this person was, but that didn\\u2019t matter at that moment. she ran downstairs and grabbed the phone. she had to think very hard about the number but eventually figured it out.  emergency number  shutterstock  \\u201c9... 1... 1...\\u201d she dialed with trembling fingers. she held the phone by her ear and ran back to he mother. \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry, mommy,\\u201d she said. \\u201ci will get you some help.\\u201d  \\u201c911, what\\u2019s your emergency?\\u201d a man asked her.  \\u201cuhm, my mommy has been asleep all day,\\u201d she said.  he tried to keep her calm  shutterstock  the man on the other line seemed to be surprised by sophie's voice. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s your name, darling?\\u201d he asked her kindly.  \\u201csophie,\\u201d sophie said confidently. \\u201ccan you come and help me?\\u201d  \\u201cyou said your mommy is asleep all day? is your daddy around, sophie?\\u201d the man asked, not reacting to sophie's question.  please stay on the line  shutterstock  \\u201cno,\\u201d sophie said. \\u201cit\\u2019s just my mommy and me. but she never woke up this morning.\\u201d  \\u201calright, sophie, i need you to stay on the line, okay?\\u201d the operator said. \\u201cwhere is your mommy now?\\u201d  \\u201cshe\\u2019s in bed in her room.\\u201d  \\u201calright, darling, you\\u2019re doing really well. do you know where you live?\\u201d he asked.  she answered all of his questions  shutterstock  sophie told the operator her address and waited. she stayed on the line with the operator the whole time and answered all his questions. he asked her if her mother was hurt, if she was breathing, and other important questions. but it was taking a very long time for the ambulance to arrive.  she had to wait  shutterstock  she was only four years old, so sophie had no track of time. but even she could sense that the ambulance should\\u2019ve been here by now, but she didn\\u2019t even hear the sirens yet. she was still by her mother's side and told her reassuring words, not knowing if her mother could hear her or not.  the sirens got closer  shutterstock  finally, after what felt like an eternity, sophie heard the sirens. she ran to the living room to wait for them to arrive. she could hear heavy footsteps running up the stairs of their apartment building and stopping in front of their door. \\u201csophie?!\\u201d one of the men yelled. \\u201ci\\u2019m in here!\\u201d she answered.  she couldn\\u2019t open the door  shutterstock  sophie's heart was pounding in her chest. she had never experienced something like this before. \\u201csophie, we need you to open the door for us,\\u201d someone yelled from the other side of the door. but that wasn\\u2019t as easy as they thought. sophie was way too small to reach the door handle.  it\\u2019s locked  shutterstock  she tried to stand on her toes to reach the handle, but she could only touch it with her fingertips. \\u201ci can\\u2019t reach it,\\u201d sophie said. but she wasn\\u2019t about to give up. she knew she had to open the door for those men. otherwise, they could never help her mother.  if only she could reach  shutterstock  there was a little black box in the middle of the dining table. so, sophie climbed on top and put the box in front of the door. she stepped on it and tried again, but she was still too small. there had to be something she could use, she thought. and suddenly, it dawned on her.  it was too heavy  shutterstock  a chair! of course, why didn\\u2019t she think of that before? sophie quickly ran back to the table and grabbed the chair. but it was way too heavy for her to lift up. she tried tugging it toward the door, but the chair got caught on a rug and slowly began to tilt.  trapped  shutterstock  because the chair began to tilt, sophie tripped. she fell on the ground face first and couldn\\u2019t turn around fast enough to see that the chair was slowly leaning her way. and before she knew it, the chair fell on top of her. sophie screamed as the hard wooden chair trapped her on the ground.  pinned to the ground  shutterstock  luckily, she wasn\\u2019t hurt, but she couldn\\u2019t get up. the chair was too heavy for her to lift. she tried to get on her hands and knees and push the chair up with her back, but she couldn\\u2019t. \\u201csophie? are you okay?\\u201d the man asked her. they could hear the rumbling noises and sophie\\u2019s screams through the door.  only one way out  shutterstock  \\u201ci\\u2019m stuck,\\u201d sophie cried out. she felt devastated. her mother was still asleep in the room, and all she wanted was to help her. and now, she was stuck under a chair, and there was no way of her opening the door from under there\\u2026 but little did she know, there was one more way the men could enter her house.  another way in  shutterstock  the police knew what to do next. \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry, sophie! we will be with you in a few minutes!\\u201d one of the officers yelled through the door. but sophie couldn\\u2019t help but feel panicked. how were the officers going to enter her house if the door was locked? but then, she heard something.  leaving her alone  shutterstock  she heard the police officers mumbling outside of the door, and it almost sounded like a few of them were walking down the stairs again. sophie\\u2019s little mind instantly feared they had given up and were about to leave her, but of course, that was far from true. \\u201cplease don\\u2019t leave me!\\u201d she cried.  brace yourself  shutterstock  \\u201cwe won\\u2019t leave you, darling!\\u201d an officer responded. \\u201cwe\\u2019re just grabbing a few supplies from downstairs. hold on tight, and don\\u2019t be scared! you will hear a loud bang in a couple of seconds.\\u201d sophie listened carefully and tried to stay as calm as possible. \\u201calright, sophie,\\u201d a second officer said. \\u201ccover your ears.\\u201d  cover your ears  shutterstock  sophie closed her eyes and put her hands over her ears. she had no idea what was going to happen next but she trusted the officers. her heart was beating in her chest, and suddenly, the officers started counting down from three to one. what were they going to do? sophie wondered.  she didn\\u2019t dare to look  shutterstock  \\u201c3.. 2.. 1!\\u201d a loud blow echoed through the living room. sophie felt the floor shake a little. she was just about to lift her hands off her ears when another blow echoed through the apartment. sophie wanted to see what they were trying to do, so she carefully opened one eye.  break down the door  shutterstock  she heard a third blow and could see the door move a little. then, she realized they were trying to break down the door with something. a fourth blow was slammed against the door, and she could now see splitters flying off. sophie quickly closed her eyes again and waited for it all to be over.  they stopped  shutterstock  but suddenly, the blows stopped. sophie opened her eyes and was worried to see the door was still in its place. why did they stop? well, breaking the door down didn\\u2019t seem to work, so the police had to think of another way. sophie could hear the police speak to each other, but it didn\\u2019t sound good.  she had to get out  shutterstock  she heard rumbling noises, and they were clearly trying lots of things to get inside. but it was taking way too long for sophie. so, she decided to take matters into her own hands. she was done being trapped on the floor and wanted to help her mother. so, she carefully looked around her.  using all of her strength  shutterstock  suddenly, sophie noticed that the legs of the chair were still on the rug that it tripped over. she reached with her arm to see if she could get her fingers in between the chair and the carpet, and to her surprise, it worked. sophie took a deep breath because she knew the next part would be very difficult.  one last push  shutterstock  sophie had to muster up all her strength to push the leg away. it hadn\\u2019t worked before, but she didn\\u2019t want to give up. she figured the chair only had to move a small bit for her to be able to crawl away. so she counted down in her head and gave the chair one big push.  she freed herself  shutterstock  to sophie's surprise, the chair began to move, and sophie was finally able to crawl away. she cheered herself on and was so proud of herself for pushing through. she immediately ran to her mother to tell her what she had accomplished but was painfully reminded that she was still sleeping.  the police arrived  shutterstock  then, all of a sudden, sophie heard a loud bang. she ran to the living room to see if the police were finally able to come inside, and they were! sophie ran into the arms of one of the officers and quickly led them to her mother. within seconds their apartment was filled with police officers and paramedics.  they were shocked  shutterstock  but none of them seemed happy. the officers looked around them with shocked looks on their faces, and the paramedics put her mother onto a stretcher. sophie didn\\u2019t understand why everyone seemed to be in such a hurry to get out of this room. but she would later find out the truth.  call an ambulance  shutterstock  they put sophie and her mother into an ambulance, and they drove to the nearest hospital. sophie knew her mother would be well cared for, but she still wondered why the police were so shocked when they entered their house. she knew she made a bit of a mess, but it wasn\\u2019t that bad, was it?  something inside  shutterstock  but little did she know it wasn\\u2019t about the mess at all. there was something else inside their apartment that explained everything, but sophie was too young to understand. she had to wait for her mother to wake up, and only then would the police explain everything as well as they could.  a terrifying situation  shutterstock  at the hospital, they hooked sophie\\u2019s mother onto various machines, which looked terrifying to sophie. she had no idea what the machines were for. luckily, sophie\\u2019s grandmother arrived soon after. they had contacted her about what had happened and asked her to come.  familiar face  shutterstock  sophie was ecstatic to see a familiar face after such a hectic day. she ran to her grandmother, snuggled up in her arms, and told her everything. it didn\\u2019t seem to get any better with hanna for a while, but after a few hours, she slowly began to wake up.  she woke up  shutterstock  hanna moved her head from side to side and slowly opened her eyes. she was very confused about what had happened and didn\\u2019t realize she was in a hospital at first. but sophie told her proudly how brave she had been all day and that she was the one who called 911.  she didn\\u2019t remember anything  shutterstock  shortly after hanna woke up, police entered her room. they began to ask her what had happened, but hanna had no idea. she went to bed feeling a bit sick, but the rest was all very blurry. the officers looked very serious and wrote everything down. but then, they finally explained everything.  a strange smell  shutterstock  when the officers were finally able to get inside the apartment, they immediately noticed something. there was a specific smell lingering around, but they didn\\u2019t connect it to anything yet. but as soon as they entered hanna\\u2019s bedroom, they were shocked to realize the smell had worsened and probably had come from there.  mold  shutterstock  they immediately investigated the situation and found mold growing behind the bed, behind the closet, and in some corners of the ceiling. the mold was slowly spreading throughout the house and was probably the reason why hanna was so sick and drowsy. the molt was toxic, and if sophie hadn\\u2019t called 911, it could\\u2019ve ended badly for them both.  doctor\\u2019s visit  shutterstock  hanna was so proud of her daughter for handling the situation so well. she felt stupid for not noticing the problem sooner. sophie was also checked for any symptoms, but luckily for her, she was perfectly healthy. the doctors don\\u2019t know why the mold only infected hanna and not sophie, but they were happy it hadn\\u2019t spread to both of them.  the entire building was effected  shutterstock  as soon as hanna started to feel better, she called the concierge of the building to explain the situation. there was no way they would go back there if there were still mold inside. the owner of the apartment building was shocked to hear something like this had happened and immediately checked the other apartments for mold as well.  a massive outbreak  shutterstock  it turned out that there was a large mold outbreak in the building, and every apartment had to be evacuated and cleaned. it was a big process that took several weeks to be finished. everyone in the building was shocked that this had happened and sent their good wishes to hanna and sophie.  forever changed  shutterstock  sophie was forever changed after this eventful day, but in a positive way. she felt more confident in who she was and more independent as well. she was very proud that she had saved her mother. the mold never returned to their apartment, and sophie grew up to become a paramedic herself and continued to save lives.  the events of this story are entirely fictional and

precise location are doing so to avoid him.  the poll, from the university of minnesota\\u2019s opinion research institute, reveals that a visceral fear of encountering elon musk is what drives eighty-nine per cent of those who follow his movements.  drilling down into the results, that percentage is even higher among people who work for elon musk.  the widespread anxiety about crossing paths with musk bodes well for a new twitter account, launched last night, which indicates locations where the tesla c.e.o. is least likely to be found.  the account, @whereelonisnt, offers users real-time updates on safe spaces where they have virtually no chance of running into musk, such as blood-donation centers and the amtrak quiet car.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

find her mother still in bed. this was extremely unusual for her because her mother always got up before her. nothing worked when she tried to wake up her mom. sophie began to wonder if something was wrong as the hours passed and her mother was still sound asleep. so she dialed the only number she could remember\\u2026  dialing 911  shutterstock  she only knew this number because her mother had instructed her to memorize it in case of an emergency. she paused before responding as tears started to well up in her eyes. sophie told the operator, \\\"my mommy has been sleeping all day.\\u201d as she spoke into the phone, her heart was pounding with anxiety.  helping the girl  shutterstock  when he heard a young child on the other end of the 911 call, the operator was shocked. as soon as he had a good idea of the situation, he dispatched police and an ambulance to her address. however, the police found that entering the apartment complex was more challenging than they had anticipated when they arrived.  stunned by what they saw  shutterstock  time seemed to pass by slowly for everyone involved. they soon became aware that they could only do one thing to enter the apartment. but when the police were finally allowed inside, they were horrified to see what they did.  what shocked the officers? what had sophie's mother been up to? and would she recover?  sophie loved her mother  shutterstock  only sophie and her mother hanna lived in the apartment. sophie was only four years old. sophie\\u2019s dad had never been in the picture. as soon as hanna informed him of her pregnancy, he left her to raise their daughter on her own. but she didn\\u2019t miss him. sophie was always well taken care of and hanna would\\u2019ve done anything for her.  her favorite part of the day  shutterstock  their favorite part of the day was the morning. after waking up and eating breakfast as a family, hanna would put on music and dance in the kitchen with her daughter. hanna would then leave for work and sophie would go to daycare. but sophie immediately recognized that today was different.  still in bed  shutterstock  as soon as sophie woke up, she noticed her mother was different. she could hardly open her eyes and wasn't her usual cheerful self. in her normal behavior, hanna would shut off the alarm on its first ring, but she had not moved a muscle since it went off. sophie got up to turn it off instead.  she wasn\\u2019t old enough to understand  shutterstock  sophie looked at her mother while standing next to her bed. she must be extremely tired, sophie thought. she wasn't old enough to comprehend how seriously wrong something could be. sophie decided to get dressed and head to the living room on her own. she was hoping her mother would soon follow her, but she never did\\u2026  time passed slowly  shutterstock  while the minutes passed, sophie's mother remained in bed asleep. the tv was on, and sophie started watching her typical morning shows. but eventually she felt a growling in her stomach. what kept her mother from getting up and dancing in the kitchen with her? she then made the decision to check on her again.  she wouldn\\u2019t wake up  shutterstock  sophie slowly opened the door to her mother's bedroom. \\u201cmom?\\u201d she asked worriedly. \\u201cmom, are you awake yet? i\\u2019m hungry.\\u201d but there came no response. she carefully walked over to the bed and climbed on top. \\u201cmommy,\\u201d she said again while shaking her mother's shoulders. she now began to feel really worried.  no response  shutterstock  her mother did not respond. sophie\\u2019s heart began to race. panic arose in her body, and tears started to well up in her eyes. she felt helpless and didn\\u2019t know what to do. but by now, she knew something strange was happening and she needed to find help.  she had to call someone  shutterstock  her mother had told her about a number she could call if something were wrong. she had no idea who this person was, but that didn\\u2019t matter at that moment. she ran downstairs and grabbed the phone. she had to think very hard about the number but eventually figured it out.  emergency number  shutterstock  \\u201c9... 1... 1...\\u201d she dialed with trembling fingers. she held the phone by her ear and ran back to he mother. \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry, mommy,\\u201d she said. \\u201ci will get you some help.\\u201d  \\u201c911, what\\u2019s your emergency?\\u201d a man asked her.  \\u201cuhm, my mommy has been asleep all day,\\u201d she said.  he tried to keep her calm  shutterstock  the man on the other line seemed to be surprised by sophie's voice. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s your name, darling?\\u201d he asked her kindly.  \\u201csophie,\\u201d sophie said confidently. \\u201ccan you come and help me?\\u201d  \\u201cyou said your mommy is asleep all day? is your daddy around, sophie?\\u201d the man asked, not reacting to sophie's question.  please stay on the line  shutterstock  \\u201cno,\\u201d sophie said. \\u201cit\\u2019s just my mommy and me. but she never woke up this morning.\\u201d  \\u201calright, sophie, i need you to stay on the line, okay?\\u201d the operator said. \\u201cwhere is your mommy now?\\u201d  \\u201cshe\\u2019s in bed in her room.\\u201d  \\u201calright, darling, you\\u2019re doing really well. do you know where you live?\\u201d he asked.  she answered all of his questions  shutterstock  sophie told the operator her address and waited. she stayed on the line with the operator the whole time and answered all his questions. he asked her if her mother was hurt, if she was breathing, and other important questions. but it was taking a very long time for the ambulance to arrive.  she had to wait  shutterstock  she was only four years old, so sophie had no track of time. but even she could sense that the ambulance should\\u2019ve been here by now, but she didn\\u2019t even hear the sirens yet. she was still by her mother's side and told her reassuring words, not knowing if her mother could hear her or not.  the sirens got closer  shutterstock  finally, after what felt like an eternity, sophie heard the sirens. she ran to the living room to wait for them to arrive. she could hear heavy footsteps running up the stairs of their apartment building and stopping in front of their door. \\u201csophie?!\\u201d one of the men yelled. \\u201ci\\u2019m in here!\\u201d she answered.  she couldn\\u2019t open the door  shutterstock  sophie's heart was pounding in her chest. she had never experienced something like this before. \\u201csophie, we need you to open the door for us,\\u201d someone yelled from the other side of the door. but that wasn\\u2019t as easy as they thought. sophie was way too small to reach the door handle.  it\\u2019s locked  shutterstock  she tried to stand on her toes to reach the handle, but she could only touch it with her fingertips. \\u201ci can\\u2019t reach it,\\u201d sophie said. but she wasn\\u2019t about to give up. she knew she had to open the door for those men. otherwise, they could never help her mother.  if only she could reach  shutterstock  there was a little black box in the middle of the dining table. so, sophie climbed on top and put the box in front of the door. she stepped on it and tried again, but she was still too small. there had to be something she could use, she thought. and suddenly, it dawned on her.  it was too heavy  shutterstock  a chair! of course, why didn\\u2019t she think of that before? sophie quickly ran back to the table and grabbed the chair. but it was way too heavy for her to lift up. she tried tugging it toward the door, but the chair got caught on a rug and slowly began to tilt.  trapped  shutterstock  because the chair began to tilt, sophie tripped. she fell on the ground face first and couldn\\u2019t turn around fast enough to see that the chair was slowly leaning her way. and before she knew it, the chair fell on top of her. sophie screamed as the hard wooden chair trapped her on the ground.  pinned to the ground  shutterstock  luckily, she wasn\\u2019t hurt, but she couldn\\u2019t get up. the chair was too heavy for her to lift. she tried to get on her hands and knees and push the chair up with her back, but she couldn\\u2019t. \\u201csophie? are you okay?\\u201d the man asked her. they could hear the rumbling noises and sophie\\u2019s screams through the door.  only one way out  shutterstock  \\u201ci\\u2019m stuck,\\u201d sophie cried out. she felt devastated. her mother was still asleep in the room, and all she wanted was to help her. and now, she was stuck under a chair, and there was no way of her opening the door from under there\\u2026 but little did she know, there was one more way the men could enter her house.  another way in  shutterstock  the police knew what to do next. \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry, sophie! we will be with you in a few minutes!\\u201d one of the officers yelled through the door. but sophie couldn\\u2019t help but feel panicked. how were the officers going to enter her house if the door was locked? but then, she heard something.  leaving her alone  shutterstock  she heard the police officers mumbling outside of the door, and it almost sounded like a few of them were walking down the stairs again. sophie\\u2019s little mind instantly feared they had given up and were about to leave her, but of course, that was far from true. \\u201cplease don\\u2019t leave me!\\u201d she cried.  brace yourself  shutterstock  \\u201cwe won\\u2019t leave you, darling!\\u201d an officer responded. \\u201cwe\\u2019re just grabbing a few supplies from downstairs. hold on tight, and don\\u2019t be scared! you will hear a loud bang in a couple of seconds.\\u201d sophie listened carefully and tried to stay as calm as possible. \\u201calright, sophie,\\u201d a second officer said. \\u201ccover your ears.\\u201d  cover your ears  shutterstock  sophie closed her eyes and put her hands over her ears. she had no idea what was going to happen next but she trusted the officers. her heart was beating in her chest, and suddenly, the officers started counting down from three to one. what were they going to do? sophie wondered.  she didn\\u2019t dare to look  shutterstock  \\u201c3.. 2.. 1!\\u201d a loud blow echoed through the living room. sophie felt the floor shake a little. she was just about to lift her hands off her ears when another blow echoed through the apartment. sophie wanted to see what they were trying to do, so she carefully opened one eye.  break down the door  shutterstock  she heard a third blow and could see the door move a little. then, she realized they were trying to break down the door with something. a fourth blow was slammed against the door, and she could now see splitters flying off. sophie quickly closed her eyes again and waited for it all to be over.  they stopped  shutterstock  but suddenly, the blows stopped. sophie opened her eyes and was worried to see the door was still in its place. why did they stop? well, breaking the door down didn\\u2019t seem to work, so the police had to think of another way. sophie could hear the police speak to each other, but it didn\\u2019t sound good.  she had to get out  shutterstock  she heard rumbling noises, and they were clearly trying lots of things to get inside. but it was taking way too long for sophie. so, she decided to take matters into her own hands. she was done being trapped on the floor and wanted to help her mother. so, she carefully looked around her.  using all of her strength  shutterstock  suddenly, sophie noticed that the legs of the chair were still on the rug that it tripped over. she reached with her arm to see if she could get her fingers in between the chair and the carpet, and to her surprise, it worked. sophie took a deep breath because she knew the next part would be very difficult.  one last push  shutterstock  sophie had to muster up all her strength to push the leg away. it hadn\\u2019t worked before, but she didn\\u2019t want to give up. she figured the chair only had to move a small bit for her to be able to crawl away. so she counted down in her head and gave the chair one big push.  she freed herself  shutterstock  to sophie's surprise, the chair began to move, and sophie was finally able to crawl away. she cheered herself on and was so proud of herself for pushing through. she immediately ran to her mother to tell her what she had accomplished but was painfully reminded that she was still sleeping.  the police arrived  shutterstock  then, all of a sudden, sophie heard a loud bang. she ran to the living room to see if the police were finally able to come inside, and they were! sophie ran into the arms of one of the officers and quickly led them to her mother. within seconds their apartment was filled with police officers and paramedics.  they were shocked  shutterstock  but none of them seemed happy. the officers looked around them with shocked looks on their faces, and the paramedics put her mother onto a stretcher. sophie didn\\u2019t understand why everyone seemed to be in such a hurry to get out of this room. but she would later find out the truth.  call an ambulance  shutterstock  they put sophie and her mother into an ambulance, and they drove to the nearest hospital. sophie knew her mother would be well cared for, but she still wondered why the police were so shocked when they entered their house. she knew she made a bit of a mess, but it wasn\\u2019t that bad, was it?  something inside  shutterstock  but little did she know it wasn\\u2019t about the mess at all. there was something else inside their apartment that explained everything, but sophie was too young to understand. she had to wait for her mother to wake up, and only then would the police explain everything as well as they could.  a terrifying situation  shutterstock  at the hospital, they hooked sophie\\u2019s mother onto various machines, which looked terrifying to sophie. she had no idea what the machines were for. luckily, sophie\\u2019s grandmother arrived soon after. they had contacted her about what had happened and asked her to come.  familiar face  shutterstock  sophie was ecstatic to see a familiar face after such a hectic day. she ran to her grandmother, snuggled up in her arms, and told her everything. it didn\\u2019t seem to get any better with hanna for a while, but after a few hours, she slowly began to wake up.  she woke up  shutterstock  hanna moved her head from side to side and slowly opened her eyes. she was very confused about what had happened and didn\\u2019t realize she was in a hospital at first. but sophie told her proudly how brave she had been all day and that she was the one who called 911.  she didn\\u2019t remember anything  shutterstock  shortly after hanna woke up, police entered her room. they began to ask her what had happened, but hanna had no idea. she went to bed feeling a bit sick, but the rest was all very blurry. the officers looked very serious and wrote everything down. but then, they finally explained everything.  a strange smell  shutterstock  when the officers were finally able to get inside the apartment, they immediately noticed something. there was a specific smell lingering around, but they didn\\u2019t connect it to anything yet. but as soon as they entered hanna\\u2019s bedroom, they were shocked to realize the smell had worsened and probably had come from there.  mold  shutterstock  they immediately investigated the situation and found mold growing behind the bed, behind the closet, and in some corners of the ceiling. the mold was slowly spreading throughout the house and was probably the reason why hanna was so sick and drowsy. the molt was toxic, and if sophie hadn\\u2019t called 911, it could\\u2019ve ended badly for them both.  doctor\\u2019s visit  shutterstock  hanna was so proud of her daughter for handling the situation so well. she felt stupid for not noticing the problem sooner. sophie was also checked for any symptoms, but luckily for her, she was perfectly healthy. the doctors don\\u2019t know why the mold only infected hanna and not sophie, but they were happy it hadn\\u2019t spread to both of them.  the entire building was effected  shutterstock  as soon as hanna started to feel better, she called the concierge of the building to explain the situation. there was no way they would go back there if there were still mold inside. the owner of the apartment building was shocked to hear something like this had happened and immediately checked the other apartments for mold as well.  a massive outbreak  shutterstock  it turned out that there was a large mold outbreak in the building, and every apartment had to be evacuated and cleaned. it was a big process that took several weeks to be finished. everyone in the building was shocked that this had happened and sent their good wishes to hanna and sophie.  forever changed  shutterstock  sophie was forever changed after this eventful day, but in a positive way. she felt more confident in who she was and more independent as well. she was very proud that she had saved her mother. the mold never returned to their apartment, and sophie grew up to become a paramedic herself and continued to save lives.  the

one irish horse trainer told wwn, not talking about the horses for once, still furious at the fact the flagship race was delayed by several excruciating minutes and giving his investors mini heart attacks, \\u201chave these idiots no idea the amount of money riding on these horses?\\u201d\",\n          \"poll: most people want to know elon musk\\u2019s location so they can avoid him\\nsan francisco (the borowitz report)\\u2014shortly after twitter suspended accounts that were tracking billionaires\\u2019 private planes, including elon musk\\u2019s, a new poll shows that most people who seek musk\\u2019s precise location are doing so to avoid him.  the poll, from the university of minnesota\\u2019s opinion research institute, reveals that a visceral fear of encountering elon musk is what drives eighty-nine per cent of those who follow his movements.  drilling down into the results, that percentage is even higher among people who work for elon musk.  the widespread anxiety about crossing paths with musk bodes well for a new twitter account, launched last night, which indicates locations where the tesla c.e.o. is least likely to be found.  the account, @whereelonisnt, offers users real-time updates on safe spaces where they have virtually no chance of running into musk, such as blood-donation centers and the amtrak quiet car.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
