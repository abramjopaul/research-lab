Ironically, she was being honored for trying to change that.  The 33-year-old London-based physicist has become something of a phenomenon herself \\u2014 both an irresistible force and immoveable object \\u2014 in her very personal campaign to bring more girls to study and work in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).  Wade has written more than 1,600 Wikipedia entries for long-ignored women scientists, and she has firm beliefs on ideas on how to support girls interested in the field.  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  Wade gained notice when, still in her 20s, she began writing the Wikipedia biographies about women and minority scientists who never got their due \\u2014 from employers, from other scientists, from the public.  As her Wikipedia entries climbed into the dozens, and then into the hundreds, she spoke and wrote more on gender equality in science. She won awards and medals and was cited by Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia.  However, not all of Wiki-world was happy with her. Several of her entries were deleted by other Wikimedians, as the most influential contributors and editors are called. She told TODAY.com that they said a handful of the women she wrote up were not all that well-known.  Wade said that\\u2019s right, that\\u2019s the problem: they should be better known.  One example was Clarice Phelps. Wade heard about the young African-American nuclear chemist, and wrote a Wikipedia bio describing her work on a team that discovered a new periodic-table element at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The Phelps entry bounced on and off Wikipedia as critics deleted it and Wade defended it. In the end, Wade won, and Phelps\\u2019 entry is back on Wikipedia for good.  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  Meanwhile, Wade\\u2019s own Wikipedia entry \\u2014 written by others, not her \\u2014 has grown to 10 printed pages.  As Wade pursues her effort to make sure women scientists are known, she also has beliefs on how to make sure the next generation gets the support they need.  She said girls don\\u2019t need \\u201cwhiz-bang\\u201d experiments at school assemblies: visiting scientists do their show, pack up, depart and nothing changes. Instead, girls and students of color need to be coached and mentored on what to study, and when.  \\u201cPeople assume girls don\\u2019t choose science because they\\u2019re not inspired,\\u201d Wade, 33, said in a recent interview. \\u201cGirls are already interested. It\\u2019s more about making students aware of the different careers in science and getting parents and teachers on board.\\u201d  Women make up only 28 percent of the U.S. work force in STEM, according to the American Association of University Women, and only one in five current engineering or computer science majors are women. Women in STEM earn $60,000 a year, compared to $85,000 for men, according to the American Association of University Women, a non-profit organization that focuses on equity for women.  \\u201cUltimately, we don\\u2019t only need to increase the number of girls choosing science, we need to increase the proportion of women who stay in science,\\u201d said Wade, whose doctorate research at Imperial College in London has been widely cited for advances in digital display technology for TV, computer and phone screens.  One key, she said, is better high school science teachers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re suffering a huge shortage of skills-specialist science teachers across the U.S. and the U.K.,\\u201d she said.  Wade said schools should make it easier for girls and students of color to apply for admissions, grants, fellowships and promotions.  \\u201cWhat do you need to do? Who do you need to speak to? When do you need to make that application? Who should be your cheerleader or supporter?\\u201d  Jessica Wade Courtesy Jess Wade  She believes schools need to be upfront about their policies on bullying and sexual harassment; universities must provide affordable child care on campus; and conference organizers should provide day care and grants for those with caring responsibilities.  Wade, who grew up the daughter of two physicians and had supportive teachers at private schools, realized at a young age that most people were not as lucky.  \\u201cI genuinely believe that science is better when it\\u2019s done by diverse teams,\\u201d she said.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s also important because we\\u2019re designing new technologies or new scientific solutions to global problems, we want the teams of people creating them to reflect the societies that they\\u2019re serving.\\u201d  \\u201cEven if you don\\u2019t care about any of that, the world desperately needs more scientists and engineers,\\u201d Wade added. \\u201cScience can help solve the world\\u2019s biggest challenges \\u2014 climate change, antibiotic resistance, emerging pandemic-inducing viruses.\\u201d  Looking back on her inclusion in the late Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s 2019 Birthday Honours list, Wade hopes young women scientists will become commonplace at future ceremonies.  And she hopes they will enjoy it as much as she did.  \\u201cIt was pretty wild to be honored by the royal family,\\u201d Wade recalled. She didn\\u2019t meet the queen, but she did take along her mother, Dr. Charlotte Feinmann, to Buckingham Palace.
