through the The Musk Foundation, has donated $5 million to American non-profit educational organization Khan Academy, which seeks to help students and teachers across the globe by providing access to free, world-class education. The donation was shared by Khan Academy founder, Salman Khan, who thanked the CEO in a YouTube video.  In his message, Khan noted that The Musk Foundation‘s $5 million donation would go a long way towards accelerating the academy’s projects. With about 20 to 30 million students using the Khan Academy’s platform every month, after all, Musk’s $5 million donation can provide a notable boost to the non-profit’s programs.  Thank you @elonmusk and @MuskFoundation for an incredible $5m donation to @khanacademy. Here is my thank you video:https://t.co/1LyABVmTyt — Salman Khan (@salkhanacademy) January 12, 2021  “Elon, I hope you really feel good about this. This is going to allow us to accelerate all sorts of content. Our aspirations are all subjects from K through the early stages of college. This will accelerate our science content, allow us to do more on early learning, allow us to make the software and practice that much more engaging for millions of students around the world, for teachers around the world,” Khan said.  Inasmuch as Elon Musk’s $5 million donation will go a long way, Khan noted that the academy still needs far more resources in the near future. The founder noted that the online academy is operating at a budget that’s about comparable to that of a large school, but it has aspirations to cater to students across the globe. With this in mind, Musk’s donation could hopefully accelerate some support for the initiative, which has touched so many lives across the globe.  Khan Academy aims to provide a free, personalized learning experience to every student, mainly built on videos that are hosted through YouTube. The academy’s website supports the videos, offering students and teachers features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and teaching tools. Mobile app support is also available.  More information about the Khan Academy could be accessed here.  Watch Salman Khan’s video about Elon Musk’s $5 million donation in the video below.  Don’t hesitate to contact us for news tips.

There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”  Nation’s Men In Bathroom Stalls Announce Plan To Breathe Really Loudly CC Share Subtitles Off  English view video Nation’s Men In Bathroom Stalls Announce Plan To Breathe Really Loudly.]\n","Category: satire\n","\n","Content:[The real reason Costco’s hot dogs cost $1.50\n","Every devout Costco shopper knows their favorite superstore has more than great deals on home goods. It sells delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price.  One of the go-to choices in the Costco food court is the hot dog and soda combo, which gets you a jumbo dog and 20 oz. soda for $1.50. In 1984, Hebrew National, the store’s hot dog supplier at the time, set up a cart outside a San Diego warehouse. Its initial success spurred Costco’s entire food court business, but the combo price hasn’t changed in over 30 years.  9 PHOTOS Shocking Costco food court secrets See Gallery Shocking Costco food court secrets The most popular item on the menu? The legendary Costco hot dog. \"There's something about a buck fifty that people really love,\" said the employee. But at 552 calories and 32 g of fat, you may want save this food court staple for special occasions. (Getty) Another discontinued item that Costco often receives questions about? The chocolate-dipped ice cream bar with almonds. We hate to break it to you, but it's probably never coming back. \"I think it might have been too expensive for the amount we give. That's what happened with gelato anyway,\" the employee said. (Getty) Everyone knows that the best churro is one that is hot and freshly made. If customers don't think they're getting the best churro their money can buy, don't be afraid to ask for a new one! The employee said, \"I learn to check when we're running low on churros and wait for a new pan to come out,\" adding, \"I recommend checking on them right before you shop and seeing the changes when you come back. My favorite is when they run out of churros and you wait for five minutes or so, then when they pull them off the pan, it is a hundred percent brand new.\" (Getty) The beloved berry smoothie was recently replaced by a different fruit smoothie -- and there's a perfectly logical (and healthy!) explanation for it. \"Corporate thought the benefits outweighed the negatives in this situation. The new smoothie has a lot of better benefits in it -- less sugar, less calories, nothing but real fruit and fruit juice, and four servings of fruit in each smoothie.\" the employee said. (Getty) Have you ever found yourself blotting away all the excess oil on your incredibly cheesy Costco pizza? There's a reason for that. The anonymous employee revealed that the amount of oil used in making the pizza is \"too much.\" In fact, upper management monitors employees to make sure they're using enough oil. \"When you don't use the corporate requested amount because you think it's too much and corporate notices? You use more oil to avoid being in trouble. Some managers overcompensate and use a quarter cup of oil+ when making them.\" Yikes! Talk about a heart attack on a plate. (Getty) And of course we're dying to know what the pizza is made out of! \"It's made with love,\" the employee jokingly said. Another Reddit user who claims to be a former employee also chimed in: \"I don't know what's in the sauce, it came to us prepared, as did the cheese mix . . . I know it was like 85 percent mozzarella and 15 percent provolone when I worked there.\" (Getty) There's no denying that Costco's chicken bake has a massive cult following. Surprisingly, the food court hit is pretty simple to make! After flattening out a lot of pizza dough, employees mix in chicken breast strips, mozzarella cheese, bacon and caesar dressing. All these ingredients are rolled up into the dough. (Getty) And if you prefer no bacon in your chicken bake, you'll have to come in earlier in the day when employees are making it. \"Sometimes the employees are running little bit late and they'll make them during the day, but you'd have to catch them before they mix the cheese and bacon. Which is hard to do,\" the employee said. \"You could always call ahead a day and ask. I'm sure they'd oblige.\" (Getty) Surprisingly, employees don't get a discount at the food court. However, they do receive a free executive membership ($120 a year), which is also a pretty impressive perk!

Costco could easily rake in millions more in annual profits by raising prices, but maintaining low prices for hot dogs and other food court eats works as a proven incentive for shoppers. For people that need to make weekly shopping trips, knowing they can buy a cheap, ready-to-eat meal when cooking is the last thing they want to do is a huge perk. That includes Costco’s other notoriously cheap item, their $4.99 rotisserie chickens. Here are six things you never knew about Costco’s famous chickens.  The convenient meal options also help justify the cost of a yearly membership, especially when $1.50 buys shoppers more food than ever. The original hot dog/soda combo included a 12 oz. can of soda and a quarter-pound hot dog. Today, it comes with a 20 oz. soda, plus free refills, and a dog that’s 10 percent bigger. That’s because Costco replaced the Hebrew National hot dogs with their own Kirkland brand product in 2009.  15 PHOTOS 15 secrets Costco employees won't tell you See Gallery 15 secrets Costco employees won't tell you We move items on purpose Our stores constantly move their stock around, so you won’t necessarily find the peanut butter in the same spot it was last time. The company touts it as a “treasure hunt,” but it also knows the more time you spend scanning the shelves, the more likely you are to notice (and buy) other items. Check out these tips for saving money at Costco. (Getty) We'll keep in item in one spot if it's selling As we move items around, we pay attention to how they’re selling. If they do particularly well in one spot, we’ll keep them there. (Getty) Pretty much everything goes on sale Wondering if you should stock up or wait? Most items will go on special eventually, so it’s worth holding off if you can be patient. Check out these things you should never buy at Costco. (Getty) You can hunt us down Got a meat question but don’t see a deli employee on the floor? Just knock on the door to the department, and we’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. (Getty) Don't sweat on missing a sale While Costco doesn’t price match with other retailers, it will honor its own sale prices on earlier returns. If you notice a costco.com item you bought had a price cut within 30 days of purchase, put in a request online to get the difference refunded. Some warehouses offer the same perk for in-store purchases, so stop by the membership counter to see if we can help. (Getty) Our rotisserie chickens are as good a deal as you hoped We aren’t downsizing our birds or adding weird fillers to keep our famous $4.99 rotisserie chickens at their low price. In fact, our chickens can weigh twice as much as our competitors’. We do add seasonings like sugar, salt, and modified corn starch (like many other store-bought rotisserie chickens), but there are no preservatives, MSG, or artificial colors and flavors. Learn more secrets behind Costco’s $4.99 rotisserie chicken. (Getty) Our price tags warn you if we aren't restocking An asterisk in the upper right corner of a price tag signals our location isn’t reordering the item. It might come back at a later time, like if it’s seasonal, but stock up now if it’s one of your favorites. Learn more about what asterisks on Costco price tags mean. (Getty) What you see is what we've got Costco is a “warehouse” store in a literal sense—we don’t have any additional storage from what you see on the shelves. If it’s not there, don’t ask us to check the “back.” The “back” doesn’t exist. Every now and then, the items will be out of reach on the high pallets, but most stores won’t bring the forklift out for just for one item. Come back tomorrow; it will probably be restocked. (Getty) You can't use manufacturer coupons We know you’d love to get an even better deal on the items in your cart, but we don’t accept manufacturers’ coupons, and we won’t negotiate for a lower price. If you want to save extra money, check our warehouse savings books. (Getty) We can help you through tragedy Steel Costco caskets can cost as little as $950, which is a steal compared to other distributors. The company currently ship to 36 states, plus the District of Columbia. Here are more Costco perks every member should know. (Getty) Put your pizza order in early On a busy Friday, you might have to wait 20 to 25 minutes for a fresh pizza. Make the most of your time by giving us your order before you start shopping so it’s finished cooking by the time you want to leave. (Getty) Our price tags have a special code Most prices end with .09 (.89, .99, etc.), but a couple price tags signal you’re getting a particularly good deal. A price ending in .97 means the item is on clearance, so you’re getting an even better deal than usual. Meanwhile, a .00 or .88 price tag signals the manager decided to cut the price, sometimes because it’s the last one in stock, doesn’t have a box, or has pieces missing. Learn more about the secret codes behind Costco’s prices. (Getty) You can get your non-member friends in It’s no big secret that you can bring two guests with you to shop, but you can set up your friends who refuse to buy a membership with their own access cards. Only members can buy and refill a Costco Cash Card, but whoever you give it to has access to the store to spend the store credit whether they have an annual membership or not. Check out these other things you can do at Costco without a membership. (Getty) You don't pay much more than the store does To make a profit, stores mark up their prices from what they pay the supplier. For instance, most grocery stores jack up meat prices by at least 30 percent. But at Costco, you won’t pay more than 15 percent more than the store does, and the prices average just a 10.6 percent markup. (Getty) We appreciate when you order ahead We normally have enough party platters in stock, but we appreciate the heads-up the day before if you know you’ll be loading up so we can prepare. We don’t mind making extra, but we hate telling customers we’re sold out because one person wiped out our stock.

The shootings left eight people dead, six of whom are Asian women.  During the conference, Baker added that Long admitted to the shootings, but denied they were racially motivated.  \\u201cThe suspect did take responsibility for the shootings,\\u201d the captain said. \\u201cHe does claim that it was not racially motivated. He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as\\u2026 a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.\\u201d  On Twitter, hundreds reacted to Capt.

According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Long purchased a gun from a Cherokee County gun shop on Tuesday before the shootings. A 9mm firearm was recovered by police when he was arrested in Crisp County that evening. The suspect was identified driving south on the freeway, but was caught by police. Long later told investigators he was on his way to Florida to commit \\u201cmore acts.\\u201d  According to the sheriff\\u2019s office, Long is being held in Cherokee County on four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.

millions of people worldwide It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and division of abnormal cells leading to the formation of tumors These tumors can invade and damage nearby tissues and

including genetics lifestyle and environmental factors While there is no guaranteed way to prevent cancer early detection and screening can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and survivalFortunately there are various treatment options available for those diagnosed with cancer Surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy and targeted therapy are all potential methods of treatment Additionally ongoing research in the field of cancer is leading to the development of new and innovative treatments and therapiesWhile cancer remains a serious health concern advancements in medical

The donation was shared by Khan Academy founder, Salman Khan, who thanked the CEO in a YouTube video.  In his message, Khan noted that The Musk Foundation\\u2018s $5 million donation would go a long way towards accelerating the academy\\u2019s projects. With about 20 to 30 million students using the Khan Academy\\u2019s platform every month, after all, Musk\\u2019s $5 million donation can provide a notable boost to the non-profit\\u2019s programs.

Here is my thank you video:https://t.co/1LyABVmTyt \\u2014 Salman Khan (@salkhanacademy) January 12, 2021  \\u201cElon, I hope you really feel good about this. This is going to allow us to accelerate all sorts of content. Our aspirations are all subjects from K through the early stages of college. This will accelerate our science content, allow us to do more on early learning, allow us to make the software and practice that much more engaging for millions of students around the world, for teachers around the world,\\u201d Khan said.  Inasmuch as Elon Musk\\u2019s $5 million donation will go a long way, Khan noted that the academy still needs far more resources in the near future. The founder noted that the online academy is operating at a budget that\\u2019s about comparable to that of a large school, but it has aspirations to cater to students across the globe. With this in mind, Musk\\u2019s donation could hopefully accelerate some support for the initiative, which has touched so many lives across the globe.  Khan Academy aims to provide a free, personalized learning experience to every student, mainly built on videos that are hosted through YouTube. The academy\\u2019s website supports the videos, offering students and teachers features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and teaching tools. Mobile app support is also available.

It sells delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price.  One of the go-to choices in the Costco food court is the hot dog and soda combo, which gets you a jumbo dog and 20 oz. soda for $1.50. In 1984, Hebrew National, the store\\u2019s hot dog supplier at the time, set up a cart outside a San Diego warehouse. Its initial success spurred Costco\\u2019s entire food court business, but the combo price hasn\\u2019t changed in over 30 years.  9 PHOTOS Shocking Costco food court secrets See Gallery Shocking Costco food court secrets The most popular item on the menu? The legendary Costco hot dog. \\\"There's something about a buck fifty that people really love,\\\" said the employee. But at 552 calories and 32 g of fat, you may want save this food court staple for special occasions. (Getty) Another discontinued item that Costco often receives questions about? The chocolate-dipped ice cream bar with almonds. We hate to break it to you, but it's probably never coming back. \\\"I think it might have been too expensive for the amount we give. That's what happened with gelato anyway,\\\" the employee said. (Getty) Everyone knows that the best churro is one that is hot and freshly made. If customers don't think they're getting the best churro their money can buy, don't be afraid to ask for a new one! The employee said, \\\"I learn to check when we're running low on churros and wait for a new pan to come out,\\\" adding, \\\"I recommend checking on them right before you shop and seeing the changes when you come back. My favorite is when they run out of churros and you wait for five minutes or so, then when they pull them off the pan, it is a hundred percent brand new.\\\" (Getty) The beloved berry smoothie was recently replaced by a different fruit smoothie -- and there's a perfectly logical (and healthy!) explanation for it. \\\"Corporate thought the benefits outweighed the negatives in this situation. The new smoothie has a lot of better benefits in it -- less sugar, less calories, nothing but real fruit and fruit juice, and four servings of fruit in each smoothie.\\\" the employee said. (Getty) Have you ever found yourself blotting away all the excess oil on your incredibly cheesy Costco pizza? There's a reason for that. The anonymous employee revealed that the amount of oil used in making the pizza is \\\"too much.\\\" In fact, upper management monitors employees to make sure they're using enough oil. \\\"When you don't use the corporate requested amount because you think it's too much and corporate notices? You use more oil to avoid being in trouble. Some managers overcompensate and use a quarter cup of oil+ when making them.\\\" Yikes! Talk about a heart attack on a plate. (Getty) And of course we're dying to know what the pizza is made out of! \\\"It's made with love,\\\" the employee jokingly said. Another Reddit user who claims to be a former employee also chimed in: \\\"I don't know what's in the sauce, it came to us prepared, as did the cheese mix . . . I know it was like 85 percent mozzarella and 15 percent provolone when I worked there.\\\" (Getty) There's no denying that Costco's chicken bake has a massive cult following. Surprisingly, the food court hit is pretty simple to make! After flattening out a lot of pizza dough, employees mix in chicken breast strips, mozzarella cheese, bacon and caesar dressing. All these ingredients are rolled up into the dough. (Getty) And if you prefer no bacon in your chicken bake, you'll have to come in earlier in the day when employees are making it. \\\"Sometimes the employees are running little bit late and they'll make them during the day, but you'd have to catch them before they mix the cheese and bacon. Which is hard to do,\\\" the employee said. \\\"You could always call ahead a day and ask. I'm sure they'd oblige.\\\" (Getty) Surprisingly, employees don't get a discount at the food court. However, they do receive a free executive membership ($120 a year), which is also a pretty impressive perk! (Getty) Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION SHOW CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE  The reason lies in the company\\u2019s business philosophy. Costco could easily rake in millions more in annual profits by raising prices, but maintaining low prices for hot dogs and other food court eats works as a proven incentive for shoppers. For people that need to make weekly shopping trips, knowing they can buy a cheap, ready-to-eat meal when cooking is the last thing they want to do is a huge perk. That includes Costco\\u2019s other notoriously cheap item, their $4.99 rotisserie chickens. Here are six things you never knew about Costco\\u2019s famous chickens.  The convenient meal options also help justify the cost of a yearly membership, especially when $1.50 buys shoppers more food than ever. The original hot dog/soda combo included a 12 oz. can of soda and a quarter-pound hot dog. Today, it comes with a 20 oz. soda, plus free refills, and a dog that\\u2019s 10 percent bigger. That\\u2019s because Costco replaced the Hebrew National hot dogs with their own Kirkland brand product in 2009.  15 PHOTOS 15 secrets Costco employees won't tell you See Gallery 15 secrets Costco employees won't tell you We move items on purpose Our stores constantly move their stock around, so you won\\u2019t necessarily find the peanut butter in the same spot it was last time.

A price ending in .97 means the item is on clearance, so you\\u2019re getting an even better deal than usual. Meanwhile, a .00 or .88 price tag signals the manager decided to cut the price, sometimes because it\\u2019s the last one in stock, doesn\\u2019t have a box, or has pieces missing.

When Officer Steven Poulos expressed his thoughts, the room went quiet: \\\"If the mayor defunds the police, I'm going to shoot her,\\\" Poulos' sergeant recalled hearing the officer say, referring to Mayor Kate Gallego.  The sergeant broke the silence, saying, \\\"You're not going to shoot the mayor.\\\"  Poulos doubled down, \\\"That's a promise,\\\" he responded.  Poulos's comments were detailed in a Tempe police report recently released to The Arizona Republic as part of a public records request. A Tempe police detective interviewed the sergeant and the other five officers who were at the meeting with Poulos.  Some officers remembered Poulos's threat differently, according to the police report.  One officer said he remembered Poulos saying, \\\"If they defund us, the first person on my list is the mayor.\\\"  A third officer remembered Poulos saying, \\\"If they defund the police, I'll go over the mayor's house and shoot it up.\\\"  Three of the officers told the Tempe detective they believed Poulos would not act on his threat because he was just venting, according to the police report.  Officer: 'It was just a joke'  After the meeting, the police report says, Poulos backtracked and told the sergeant his comments were a joke.  \\\"I don't know why they make a bid (big) deal about it, it was just a joke,\\\" Poulos told the sergeant, according to the police report.  The comments, whether made in jest or not, were taken seriously. The Phoenix Police Department asked Tempe police to criminally investigate the case. Phoenix police also opened an internal affairs investigation to determine if Poulos violated any policies. That report has not been released.  The Tempe police detective has forwarded the report to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, which will decide if it will prosecute Poulos. The case was submitted for review of charges of making a terrorist threat and threatening or intimidating someone, according to the police report.  Poulos told the Tempe police detective that he would not provide a statement.  Poulos and his attorney, Josephine Hallam, declined to comment to The Republic.  Sgt. Mercedes Fortune, a spokeswoman for the Phoenix police, said in an email on Tuesday that Poulus is on administrative leave. She also said the administrative investigation is ongoing.  Prosecutors are still reviewing the case for any possible charges, said Jennifer Liewer, a spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Attorney's Office.  Gallego had not read the police report before The Republic sent it to her office on Monday. The mayor declined to comment on the threat, including whether she wanted the officer to be prosecuted, until she had time to review the report, according to her communications director Jeanine L\\u2019Ecuyer.  Who is Steven Poulos?  Poulos joined the Phoenix Police Department in 1998 after four years with the Pittsburgh Police Department.  Poulos qualifies for retirement since he has worked for the Phoenix department for more than 20 years.  He is currently set to get a cash payout when he does, according to city documents. In early October, before his threatening comments, the city\\u2019s police pension board approved a deferred retirement plan for him.  That means that he will start to accumulate monthly retirement payments now, to be paid as a lump sum when he retires, in addition to his monthly retirement payments, according to a description of the deferred retirement program on the Arizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System website.  He must retire within five years.  Protests over police violence  Poulos's comments were made as some City Council members and advocates have demanded transparency and accountability from the Phoenix Police Department in police shootings and for police misconduct.  While Gallego has been supportive of creating a civilian oversight office to review police shootings and excessive force claims, she has not supported cutting the Police Department's budget.  In fact, Gallego, and the City Council, has voted to increase the Police Department's budget in June and last year, when she became mayor.  Relations between some City Council members and the Police Department have been tense, particularly this year when thousands of people marched in Phoenix, demanding police accountability. The demonstrations were spurred by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier this year and fueled by the killing of Muhammad Abdul Muhaymin Jr. in Phoenix and Dion Johnson by a Department of Public Safety trooper in Scottsdale.  Councilman Carlos Garcia has been the most vocal critic of the Phoenix Police Department for its high rate of police shootings and use of force cases over the past decade.  The Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, the union that represents the Police Department's rank and file, has criticized Garcia and Gallego on its Facebook page, saying that they do not support police officers.  In June, PLEA asked Gallego and every council member to take a \\\"public stance and support Phoenix police officers.\\\" The union has frequently noted on its Facebook page that Gallego has not responded to the request.  The posts often spur dozens of comments against the mayor. Some call her an \\u201cidiot\\\" or other names. Others suggest that the city should remove her security detail \\u2014 city police officers \\u2014 until she announces her full support for the police.

It sells delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price.  One of the go-to choices in the Costco food court is the hot dog and soda combo, which gets you a jumbo dog and 20 oz. soda for $1.50. In 1984, Hebrew National, the store\\u2019s hot dog supplier at the time, set up a cart outside a San Diego warehouse. Its initial success spurred Costco\\u2019s entire food court business, but the combo price hasn\\u2019t changed in over 30 years.  9 PHOTOS Shocking Costco food court secrets See Gallery Shocking Costco food court secrets The most popular item on the menu? The legendary Costco hot dog. \\\"There's something about a buck fifty that people really love,\\\" said the employee. But at 552 calories and 32 g of fat, you may want save this food court staple for special occasions. (Getty) Another discontinued item that Costco often receives questions about? The chocolate-dipped ice cream bar with almonds. We hate to break it to you, but it's probably never coming back. \\\"I think it might have been too expensive for the amount we give. That's what happened with gelato anyway,\\\" the employee said. (Getty) Everyone knows that the best churro is one that is hot and freshly made. If customers don't think they're getting the best churro their money can buy, don't be afraid to ask for a new one! The employee said, \\\"I learn to check when we're running low on churros and wait for a new pan to come out,\\\" adding, \\\"I recommend checking on them right before you shop and seeing the changes when you come back. My favorite is when they run out of churros and you wait for five minutes or so, then when they pull them off the pan, it is a hundred percent brand new.\\\" (Getty) The beloved berry smoothie was recently replaced by a different fruit smoothie -- and there's a perfectly logical (and healthy!) explanation for it. \\\"Corporate thought the benefits outweighed the negatives in this situation. The new smoothie has a lot of better benefits in it -- less sugar, less calories, nothing but real fruit and fruit juice, and four servings of fruit in each smoothie.\\\" the employee said. (Getty) Have you ever found yourself blotting away all the excess oil on your incredibly cheesy Costco pizza? There's a reason for that. The anonymous employee revealed that the amount of oil used in making the pizza is \\\"too much.\\\" In fact, upper management monitors employees to make sure they're using enough oil. \\\"When you don't use the corporate requested amount because you think it's too much and corporate notices? You use more oil to avoid being in trouble. Some managers overcompensate and use a quarter cup of oil+ when making them.\\\" Yikes! Talk about a heart attack on a plate. (Getty) And of course we're dying to know what the pizza is made out of! \\\"It's made with love,\\\" the employee jokingly said. Another Reddit user who claims to be a former employee also chimed in: \\\"I don't know what's in the sauce, it came to us prepared, as did the cheese mix . . . I know it was like 85 percent mozzarella and 15 percent provolone when I worked there.\\\" (Getty) There's no denying that Costco's chicken bake has a massive cult following. Surprisingly, the food court hit is pretty simple to make! After flattening out a lot of pizza dough, employees mix in chicken breast strips, mozzarella cheese, bacon and caesar dressing. All these ingredients are rolled up into the dough. (Getty) And if you prefer no bacon in your chicken bake, you'll have to come in earlier in the day when employees are making it. \\\"Sometimes the employees are running little bit late and they'll make them during the day, but you'd have to catch them before they mix the cheese and bacon. Which is hard to do,\\\" the employee said. \\\"You could always call ahead a day and ask. I'm sure they'd oblige.\\\" (Getty) Surprisingly, employees don't get a discount at the food court. However, they do receive a free executive membership ($120 a year), which is also a pretty impressive perk! (Getty) Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION SHOW CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE  The reason lies in the company\\u2019s business philosophy. Costco could easily rake in millions more in annual profits by raising prices, but maintaining low prices for hot dogs and other food court eats works as a proven incentive for shoppers. For people that need to make weekly shopping trips, knowing they can buy a cheap, ready-to-eat meal when cooking is the last thing they want to do is a huge perk. That includes Costco\\u2019s other notoriously cheap item, their $4.99 rotisserie chickens. Here are six things you never knew about Costco\\u2019s famous chickens.  The convenient meal options also help justify the cost of a yearly membership, especially when $1.50 buys shoppers more food than ever. The original hot dog/soda combo included a 12 oz. can of soda and a quarter-pound hot dog. Today, it comes with a 20 oz. soda, plus free refills, and a dog that\\u2019s 10 percent bigger. That\\u2019s because Costco replaced the Hebrew National hot dogs with their own Kirkland brand product in 2009.  15 PHOTOS 15 secrets Costco employees won't tell you See Gallery 15 secrets Costco employees won't tell you We move items on purpose Our stores constantly move their stock around, so you won\\u2019t necessarily find the peanut butter in the same spot it was last time.

The idea behind these controversial state laws -- which have received opposition from anti-vaccination activists -- is that requiring more children to get vaccinated, unless they have a medical reason not to, can help reduce the spread of disease.  Yet does such strict legislation really lead to more children being up-to-date on their vaccine requirements? A new study suggests yes, at least in California.  The new study involved analyzing annual data about kindergartners and their vaccination status at the start of school between 2000 and 2017. They looked at the data before and after three specific interventions took place: two vaccine-related policies and one education campaign.  The yearly rate of kindergartners without an up-to-date vaccination status rose from 7.8% in the year 2000 to 9.84% in 2013 -- before the policies and campaign -- and then the rate fell to 4.87% in 2017 -- after the policies and campaign -- according to the study published in the medical journal JAMA on Tuesday.]\\nCategory=\",\n          \"Categorize these content\\nContent: [Tesla\\u2019s Elon Musk donates $5 million to free education platform Khan Academy.\\nBy  Elon Musk, through the The Musk Foundation, has donated $5 million to American non-profit educational organization Khan Academy, which seeks to help students and teachers across the globe by providing access to free, world-class education.

(Getty) What you see is what we've got Costco is a \\u201cwarehouse\\u201d store in a literal sense\\u2014we don\\u2019t have any additional storage from what you see on the shelves. If it\\u2019s not there, don\\u2019t ask us to check the \\u201cback.\\u201d The \\u201cback\\u201d doesn\\u2019t exist. Every now and then, the items will be out of reach on the high pallets, but most stores won\\u2019t bring the forklift out for just for one item. Come back tomorrow; it will probably be restocked.

Make the most of your time by giving us your order before you start shopping so it\\u2019s finished cooking by the time you want to leave. (Getty) Our price tags have a special code Most prices end with .09 (.89, .99, etc.), but a couple price tags signal you\\u2019re getting a particularly good deal. A price ending in .97 means the item is on clearance, so you\\u2019re getting an even better deal than usual. Meanwhile, a .00 or .88 price tag signals the manager decided to cut the price, sometimes because it\\u2019s the last one in stock, doesn\\u2019t have a box, or has pieces missing.

Only members can buy and refill a Costco Cash Card, but whoever you give it to has access to the store to spend the store credit whether they have an annual membership or not. Check out these other things you can do at Costco without a membership. (Getty) You don't pay much more than the store does To make a profit, stores mark up their prices from what they pay the supplier. For instance, most grocery stores jack up meat prices by at least 30 percent. But at Costco, you won\\u2019t pay more than 15 percent more than the store does, and the prices average just a 10.6 percent markup. (Getty) We appreciate when you order ahead We normally have enough party platters in stock, but we appreciate the heads-up the day before if you know you\\u2019ll be loading up so we can prepare. We don\\u2019t mind making extra, but we hate telling customers we\\u2019re sold out because one person wiped out our stock.
